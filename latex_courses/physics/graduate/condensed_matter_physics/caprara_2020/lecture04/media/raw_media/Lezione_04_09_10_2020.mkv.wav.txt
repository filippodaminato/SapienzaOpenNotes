 I'm really excited about this video.
 Guys, if you believe what Intel tells you, you'd think that this Core i9-9900...
 Today, for you ladies and gentlemen, I have the privilege, nay, the honor of being the first outside of NVIDIA to experience 8K gaming on this LG ZX series 88-inch OLED gaming...
 ...persino Google lo sa, che registrare una riunione senza il previo consenso può essere illegale, quindi perseguibile.
 Però invece, problemi del professore. Cavoli suoi. No, neanch'io. In teoria neanch'io, perché se registro, come sto facendo adesso, risulta chiaramente...
 Potrebbe Google chiedere comunque una conferma al...
 Sì, ma di fatto questo... Allora, perché io sto registrando? Non perché a me mi piaccia registrarmi.
 Mi sopporto già un numero sufficiente di ore al giorno, perché ci sono studenti che hanno difficoltà a seguire,
 in particolare gli studenti italiani hanno fissionari, rendono incompatibili.
 Lo dico però io la devo rendere pubblica a queste in qualche modo, che ancora non ho capito come.
 E quando io rendo pubblico a queste, non è che sto solo riprendendo me stesso, allora va bene, facendo.
 Sono abituato, gli studenti mi registrano sempre, o con il telesolminico, registratori, eccetera.
 Ma rendo pubblico questo, dove c'è scritto anche chi c'era, che domande ha fatto.
 Per esempio, supponiamo che uno non volesse far sapere alla fidanzata che era venuta all'università,
 gli aveva detto, no, sono male, e invece voglio venire a studiare fisica.
 La fidanzata ha detto, no, non ci possiamo vedere perché sto male.
 Poi la fidanzata dice, uomo, stavi a fisica invece di stare con me.
 Allora, succedono dei guai, no, è un problema serio relativo alla privacy.
 E questo io non lo posso evitare, né mi sento in diritto di ignorare questo problema.
 E quindi io non so ancora come renderò disponibile queste lezioni che sto giustando.
 Lo scoprirò vivendo.
 Sì, ma chi? Per esempio tutti quelli che erano presenti oggi, allora è inutile, l'hanno già vista.
 Ci sono persone che non sono presenti oggi, ma che io non l'ho capito, però certo cercherò di capirlo perché a questo punto...
 ...due erano tantissime questioni di questo tema che abbiamo fatto in la prima lezione, quindi ho deciso di scrivere notes.
 Quindi in writing sono quasi complete, non quasi, ma quasi complete, perché ci sono due problemi.
 Uno è il problema che non ho ricordato la prima parte della lezione, e l'altro problema è che, ovviamente,
 sono un pre-requisito di questo corso, e sono stati in un Syllabus, che lo puoi trovare sul mio sito.
 Quindi, io sono aware che non all of you compiliano con le point che dovrebbero essere compliati in un Syllabus.
 Quindi, io assumo che ti conosco termodinamica, statistica mecanica, e so on e so fort,
 at the level di Bachelore.
 But then I understand from the questions that I receive that, okay, this is not so given for granted, let's say.
 It's at least some of the notions are shaky, not really firm.
 So, just to catch up, in the previous lecture we have been
 formulating the problem of x-ray scattering from a crystal in Bragg's formulation.
 Bragg's formulation assumes that there exist lattice planes and two, they are perfect mirrors.
 Under these two assumptions, which are uncontrolled, I can ask a question about the condition
 for constructive interference between two rays that are reflected by two neighboring planes,
 so according to the notation which is customary in X-ray scattering that I call with theta,
 the angle that the ray forms with respect to the plane, not with respect to the normal,
 which is the customary notation in optics.
 Here I call theta this angle here, then I have another parallel ray, this angle is again theta, this is again theta.
 I have my source, and I have my detector.
 The question is when will I observe a constructive interference in the detector, and the answer is whenever the difference in the optical path of two rays is a multiple of the wavelength.
 And this gives rise to Bragg condition. If I call d the distance between two planes, I have the condition 2d sin of the angle theta is equal to a multiple of the wavelength.
 And this is known as Bragg condition.
 Now, before we go to the question how to implement in an experiment this condition, I want first to discuss formulae formulation and then compare the two formulations.
 Excuse me professor, I have a question for the last lecture. We described the structure factor in a mathematical way with an integration but for me it's not yet clear what does it describe physically in our crystal or lattice.
 yes so i cannot answer this question now because this will interrupt my lecture it's out of topic now so i will come back as soon as this become not so much of topic or if you wait till the end of the lecture then i can reply to this this is completely off topic with respect to what we are doing now so i will reply whenever this is possible without interrupting me so now i want to address this
 for our formulation of the problem of x-ray scattering so in for our formulation there is my crystal
 a source and a detector and that's it
 so my source is sending x-rays and my detector is receiving x-rays
 from my crystal
 in von laura's function the scatterers are not lattice plates but individual atoms
 so light is scattered by individual atoms let's take two such atoms
 one is here and the other is there
 the only assumption is that the scattering is elastic
 which is a very good assumption in the case of hard x-ray
 of course if i send the light onto atoms i can have several processes
 like i can excite the atom or i can even take away electrons from the atoms
 but when dealing with the hard x-ray what happens is that the x-ray
 is mostly scattered elastically by the atom so this is a physical assumption
 nothing like there exists in lattice place is a physical assumption which is very reasonable
 in the case of hard x-ray scattering and of course now i have two angles in my problem
 and those two angles are fixed by the position of the source and the position of the detectors which
 i can choose i decide where i put my source and where i put my detector and then i can move
 either source and or the detector then i have
 a vector d that locates one atom with respect to the other
 and i have two angles in the problem one is the angle theta and the other is the angle theta prime
 that are formed by the incoming and the upcoming x-ray with respect to the vector that locates
 one atom with respect to the other
 this has
 wave vector k this is that wave vector k prime and since the scattering is elastic the only condition
 is that the magnitude of k is equal to the magnitude of k prime which means that the wavelength
 of the two x-rays is the same there is no change in wavelength like we have in compton
 scattering this is not compton scattering you see elastic schedule so let's call with
 n and n prime the unit vector with respect to the incoming and outgoing
 x-ray then again if we ask ourselves what is the condition under which
 i see a constructive interference in my detector then such a condition is the condition that
 the difference in the optical path is again a multiple number of wavelength
 so we have to calculate the difference in the optical path
 so i project one ray onto the other and the difference in the optical path is the sum of
 this segment and this segment the two segments are not the same length but nonetheless this is
 the difference in the optical path so i can write d cos theta plus d cos theta prime
 people and lambda this is von lauer condition
 now we realize that these two objects can be written in the form of a scalar product
 because i rewrite the vector d here and this magnified just for
 purposes of clarity and then if i take
 n the unit vector in the direction of k the angle theta is just the angle between d and t
 and n so we can write this as d dot n
 in this case if i now draw n prime which is in this direction
 n prime this angle is the complementary angle
 that n prime forms with d so this is minus d dot n prime
 and this product must be a multiple and this sum must be a multiple an integer multiple of the wavelength
 now i multiply both sides of this equality by 2 pi over lambda
 2 pi over lambda time n is the wave vector k
 2 pi over lambda times and prime is the wave vector k prime and this is 2 pi over lambda times
 n lambda is 2 pi n an integer multiple of 2 pi now i look at this equality and i realize that d
 is a vector that joins two atoms in my lattice and this condition must be true for all atoms in my
 lattice because if this interference is constructive but the interference with all other atoms is
 destructive then this spot will be very faint i need to have constructive interference from all
 atoms at least all atoms that are in the spot of my x-ray where my x-ray hits the crystal so this
 equality must hold true whenever d is a brevet lattice vector a brevet lattice vector is a vector
 that locates all the atoms with respect to one atom that we choose as the origin so we read this
 equality i write it here as r dot k minus k prime equal to two pi and an integer multiple of two pi
 but now i look at this equality
 and this is exactly the quality that defines the reciprocal lattice
 r times a vector equal to pi n so for our condition for
 constructive interference translate into the following k minus k prime is the capital k
 belonging to the reciprocal lattice
 so surprise whenever i do an x-ray scattering experiment on a crystal and i change the position of my detector
 i will observe either nothing or a bright spot and the bright spot will be found whenever the
 difference between k and a prime is a reciprocal lattice vector of my lattice so as i stated from
 the beginning with this ray scattering actually we are seeing the reciprocal lattice of my crystal
 not directly the crystal but it's reciprocal but since we know that there is a one-to-one
 correspondence between the reciprocal lattice and the original lattice once we reconstruct the
 reciprocal lattice we have direct access to the structure of the brevet lattice that originated this
 x-ray scheduling
 so now we have two formulations of the same problem
 one is bragg formulation
 and he was awarded the nobel prize so this equation works
 and from lauer formulation and he also was awarded the nobel prize so pratt and from lauer formulation
 both work then it may be that the two formulations are equivalent they are and now i'm going to show
 that they are equivalent so we have two different formulations
 of the same problem one assumes the existence of lattice planes to start with
 and assume that lattice planes behave as perfect mirrors
 so it's less transparent the other formulation
 only makes very very transparent physically transparent assumptions like
 the scattering is elastic and the scatterers are the nodes of my lattice
 and the scattered wave goes in all directions the scattering is
 completely isotropic what selects the k' direction
 is that i put my detector somewhere so the scattered wave is a spherical wave
 but i am looking in a given direction which is fixed by the
 position of my detector and then i can move the detector so i
 can change k prime for instance given k i can change k prime
 and so now i fix k i change k prime i change the k prime and i see nothing
 nothing nothing right spot when do i see a bright spot whenever
 k minus k prime is equal to a reciprocal lattice value
 this will make and i will try to convince you that this is the case
 a discrete set of spots which is the fingerprint of the given
 lattice it is the fingerprint of the of the of the reciprocal lattice but in the end once we have
 the fingerprint of the reciprocal lattice by the direct correspondence between reciprocal and
 direct lattice we have also access to the structure of the brevet lattice so now i will try to convince
 you that there is a complete equivalence of the two formulations now this equivalence rests on a
 theorem that we have already proved we have proved that given a reciprocal lattice vector
 there always exists a family of lattice planes perpendicular to that reciprocal lattice and that
 the shortest of all reciprocal lattice vector is just two pi over d where d is the distance between the planes
 so now we see the ingredients of Bragg's formulation in von Laue formulation and we have only to put
 everything in order so that this equivalence become transparent and evident
 so i write it here what we will use
 given K belonging to the reciprocal lattice
 there exists a family
 of lattice planes
 perpendicular to K
 and K is an integer multiple of the shortest of all K
 and the shortest with n equal one as length two pi over d where d is the distance all the others
 can be larger and so their magnitude is two times three times an integer number of times why an integer
 because the reciprocal lattice is a prevail lattice and so vectors can only be integer multiples of
 the fundamental vector so whenever i have a fundamental vector in one direction all the
 vectors that i can have are multiples of this fundamental so this ingredient is crucial in
 transforming from lower condition into bra condition let's see how so from this equation i can write
 k prime equal to k minus capital k
 then i can take the modulus of both sides and use the fact that the modulus of k is equal to
 the modulus of k prime so we have the modulus of k prime is equal to the modulus of k
 and this the simplest way to calculate the modulus of this vector is to take the scalar
 product with itself so i have k dot k which is k squared then i have two times the double product
 and then i have the magnitude of capital k
 for a triangle this is carnot's theorem for the length of the side of the triangle given the length
 of the other two sides and the angle between them now as you see here i have used the elasticity of my
 scattering so these two are the same and i can find that k dot capital k is equal to one half of k squared
 now let me write capital k as the magnitude of capital k times a unit vector in the direction of capital k
 and then
 you immediately see that the projection of k along the direction of capital k
 is just one half of the length of capital k
 so this is my capital k
 this is k and this is
 the projection of k
 onto
 my
 revelation a reciprocal vector k is just one ounce of the total length of k
 so this triangle is isosceles so that this side is the same length of this side
 actually this weight vector
 is immediately related to
 k prime because we have that
 k plus k prime is equal to k so this is this is k prime this is minus k prime
 k plus minus k prime equal capital k then if now i make this a prime
 this is a lattice plane perpendicular to my greater lattice vector and the lattice plane
 behaves as a perfect mirror for my x-ray scattering so this is exactly bragg's assumption
 this is the angle theta this angle is theta the theta in bragg's formulation
 and so now we can write
 that magnitude of k
 sine of theta is equal to one half of the magnitude of capital k
 this is bragg's theta the angle that my x-ray forms with the lattice plane
 and if i take the magnitude of k times the sine of theta i find exactly one half of the magnitude
 of capital k and now i put the number what is the magnitude of k two pi over lambda
 what is the magnitude of capital k an integer number n times two pi over d
 and then i simplify two pi i multiply both members and i get two d sine of theta
 equal n lambda which is exactly
 Bragg's condition derived from Von Laue's condition
 now we understand also the meaning of n
 whenever we see a scattering of capital k we have one of the two possibilities even this capital k is
 the shortest and so we are seeing the first reflection from that family of lattice plates
 then we can have k that is a multiple of this and then we are seeing reflections by
 a k vector that is two times three times so the wavelength of this is one half one third one
 fourth of with respect to the distance of my lattice planes and so all those waves have the same
 periodicity and one is the fundamental which is the shortest level so increasing n in Bragg's formulation
 means increasing the magnitude of k in formula formulation so i am taking vectors k and k prime
 that differ by increasingly larger vectors when n increases k minus k prime increases and so i am taking
 larger and larger vectors whenever the difference is a reciprocal at this vector i see a bright spot
 in my detection i stop for a while and ask for questions about this subject
 so okay
 so
 from lauer's formulation is clearer in my opinion it has assumption underlying the underlying
 assumptions are very reasonable in the end it is completely equivalent to brad's formulation
 so to determine the x-ray diffraction pattern from a crystal we can use both they give the same result
 if we adopt the standpoint of from lauer's construction from lauer formulation this will
 give us an idea of how to implement experimentally x-ray scaling to study the property of a given
 crystal and so i will discuss this setup which is based on the aval deconstruction
 so imagine to have your reciprocal lattice
 what i'm drawing here is not the crystal lattice it's the reciprocal lattice okay
 now take at your choice one side as the origin of your reference frame in reciprocal space
 so i choose this atom this sorry this point we are in reciprocal space this point has the origin in
 my reciprocal space then the recipe goes like this from this point take the vector k from the origin
 i go with my vector k k is fixed by the position of my source so if my source is here
 then we produce x-ray in this direction and if i fix the wavelength of my
 radiation then i will fix both the direction and the magnitude of k
 then
 this point c identifies the center of a sphere
 which is called the hevald sphere i take c and i make a sphere of radius k
 this sphere
 may meet some point of reciprocal space
 different from the origin
 what does this mean this is k this is another vector that i call k prime
 and their difference since this is the origin and this is a reciprocal lattice
 point different from the origin is a reciprocal lattice vector k so
 my situations is that this is this is minus k prime sorry this is minus k prime
 k prime is in the other direction this is minus k prime so this construction tells me
 that whenever my evil spheres touches a reciprocal lattice point the corresponding
 k prime is a possible scattered x-ray that gives me a bright spot because it obeys
 the phone lower condition so i say it again i choose an origin whatever because all points are
 equivalent i fix my k and this define in a unique way the center c then i make a sphere of radius
 k if this sphere touches another reciprocal lattice point of more than one all those reciprocal
 lattice points are such that by definition of a sphere the length of this wave vector is the same
 as this so i am obeying the elasticity and the sum of these two vector is a reciprocal lattice vector
 and so i am satisfying for lara condition and so in this direction now i write the direction in the
 direction k prime if i put my detector here i will observe a bright spot in my sphere if i put my
 detector here i will not see a bright spot if i put my detector here i will see a bright spot
 okay
 now this construction is very simple because it allows to predict given a structure
 what will be observed of course usually in experiment we don't know the structure
 and we want to deduce the structure from the location of the bright spot so we have to implement
 this idea in different ways because you see if i fix k then of course i have access only to very few
 lattice points if any that obey the condition that other point in reciprocal lattice are on the evil
 sphere so if i am lucky i will find some bright spot if i am unlucky i will find nothing and this is not
 a map of my crystal it's just if i am lacking few bright spots i want more if i want more i can do
 several things one thing is that i can vary the wavelength of k suppose for instance that i
 vary the wavelength of k between two values it means that i am now increasing my wave vector k
 which means that i am reducing the wavelength and if i do this gradually as you see my
 ever sphere will touch many points that will be spun by my construction so i will meet also point
 when i increase my length my radius of the ever sphere will change in a continuous way and so my
 ever sphere will span a region in reciprocal space and whenever by spanning it meets some reciprocal
 lattice point i will find a bright spot so it's a way of spanning at least a portion of my reciprocal space
 if i change my wave vector from
 k1 to k2 my wavelength goes from lambda 2 to lambda 1 and so by changing the wavelength of my x-ray
 i can span a portion of my reciprocal space
 this is one possibility the other possibility is that i fix i erase so that i can redraw
 another possibility is that i fix my advanced sphere
 so for instance if this is k
 i have a sphere is
 this
 very unlucky i didn't get any single point
 okay because i have taken this but now i rotate my crystal
 rotating the crystal in real space counter rotates the crystal in reciprocal space
 so that now if this is the origin all point in reciprocal space will describe circumferences
 and sooner or later they will meet the island sphere whenever by rotating my crystal one point
 meets the other sphere i see a bright spot because now the evil condition is met so by
 rotating my crystal i actually rotate also my reciprocal lattice and so points that
 they were not touched by yellow sphere may sooner or later intersect the
 intersect the yellow sphere and this is called the rotating crystal method
 of course one can use combination of both methods i can rotate a crystal and change the wavelength
 so linear combinations of the two methods in principle i can both change the wavelength
 and rotate the crystal so as to span a good portion of reciprocal space i will try to convince
 you that i must not exhaust all reciprocal space it's infinite fortunately enough
 once i have a few points in reciprocal space i can immediately figure out what is the corresponding
 brevet lattice because of course i can take advantage of periodicity i know that reciprocal
 space must be periodic so if i find the first points in reciprocal space then i can map the
 entire space by periodicity and so it is not necessary to find all the points in reciprocal
 space to figure out the structure few spots
 few bright spots in my x-ray scattering pattern are enough to deduce the property of the crystal
 the first method was the one that was invented by lauer himself so this is called lauer method
 the method of changing the wavelength which means changing the radius of evil sphere
 sorry professor yes can you repeat the method of rotating crystal so now i fix the origin
 this is arbitrary and i put my wave vector of the incoming light k
 this defines the evil sphere which is a sphere centered in the end point of k
 and of radius the magnitude of k this is evil sphere if i am very unlucky like in the case i
 depicted i am missing all points in reciprocal lattice so if this is my setup and then i move my
 detector all around i will see no bright spot there is no reciprocal lattice point that is reached
 by this condition k minus q prime equal capital k with k prime in absolute value equal to k
 but now i say okay if i rotate my crystal in real space i am rotating my crystal in reciprocal
 actually i'm counter-rotating but this is not very important because the scalar product
 r dot k is invariant so if i am rotating r i'm counter-rotating k so as to maintain the
 scalar product invariant this is not important what i'm doing is that i am rotating my reciprocal
 lattice vector so let's take one receiver of a lattice point and this rotates along a circumference
 so which is centered at the origin and with radius this and sooner or later i will intercept
 a sphere as soon as i do intersect according to for laurie condition i will observe in a specific
 direction a bright spot usually one puts okay this was at those time i had a photographic film all
 around my sample or almost all around my sample so that whenever there was a condition that was
 satisfied my film was impressed by the x-ray and so then i developed the film and located the bright
 spots on my film of course the film was sensitive to x-ray not visible but okay so when i rotate my
 crystal sooner or later the points even if they are not touched by the yellow sphere once i draw it
 they can reach the yellow sphere under rotation in that case as soon as they touch the yellow sphere
 i will observe a bright spot in my x-ray diffraction pattern
 thank you you're welcome
 the last method that i want to discuss
 is a method due to the buy and share
 this method
 seems hopeless at the first glance
 but then and i try to convince you about this
 it actually works very efficiently
 because even if we lose information about the direction of capital k
 this will be the case
 nonetheless
 even if we only know the length of the first
 reciprocal space wave vector only their length not their direction
 i will show you that this is already a good fingerprint to tell which is the lattice i was
 starting with it's not even necessary to know the direction of capital k just few lengths will
 completely characterize the lattice so first i'll tell you this was a spoiler but first i'll tell you
 the idea so there are crystals that are naturally found in a polycrystalline form they naturally grow
 in such a way that they are divided into domains each domain is a crystallite a small crystal
 but the domains are arranged at random in space so that if i have a cubic here
 i have a rotated cubic here and this cubic here rotated in all possible direction spaces
 so
 of course my x-ray spot is large enough so that when i shine my x-ray on my crystal
 my x-rays sees all the different crystallites
 but i can do i can put myself in such a condition
 even if i have a crystal to start with because i can grind my crystal
 and transform my crystal into a powder so this is also called the powder method
 so i start with a nice crystal and then i grind it and i put
 my powder
 in a vessel and so now my powder each grain of powder is still huge with respect to the typical
 cycle of an atom so each ground each grain of power is itself like a crystallite here so where now i
 have again all my crystals oriented in different ways and i shine my system with an x-ray my x-ray sees
 the average of this so what is the advantage is that i am rotating my crystal automatically so my x-ray
 sees the average of my x-ray factor with respect to all possible rotations of my crystal because i am
 effectively rotating my crystallites so it's like implementing the rotating crystal method
 without rotating the crystals because the crystal is kind of rotated by the fact that there are
 crystallites in all possible orientations in this case there is a construction that tells me when
 i can expect constructive interference now of course since i am mediating with respect to the
 directions i have no access to the direction of my reciprocal space wave vector because a bright spot
 will be a bright spot that may be may receive contributions from different k vectors provided
 they are the same length because i am rotating my crystal so i lose information about the direction
 of my reciprocal space weight vector but nonetheless as i'll show you in some exercises this is still
 enough to fully reconstruct the structure of my so what is the construction that i make with this
 so the question is what is the difference between the figure on the left and the figure on the right
 in the figure on the left i went to the to a shop and i bought a crystal that is
 in a polycrystalline form from the start it's the crystal falls in in this way in nature so it's a
 polycrystalline material there i had a very nice crystal like a coarse crystal and then i ground it
 and i obtain a powder and then i put my powder into a vessel usually this is compressed into polyester
 i make with those the powders of my crystal one way or another i obtain the same effect
 here every crystallite is a crystal and by putting a crystallite one
 beside another i have all possible orientations of my crystal there since each grain of powder is
 near other grains of father and they are oriented at random again i am putting my crystal in all
 possible orientations so they are two different ways to average over the orientation of my crystal
 which means that at once i'm seeing all the possible rotations of my crystal
 so it's like implementing in one shot the rotating crystal method because now i if i rotate this
 nothing will change because this is now fully isotropic so however i rotate this crystal
 or this powder i get always the same nothing will change because now i will get at once
 with one shot what i would get from a single crystal by rotating it
 so
 let's now construct
 evans here
 this is my origin
 oh so
 i have the center c my k here
 and a possible candidate for k prime say here
 now i have another sphere
 this is capital k and so i have another sphere of radius capital k
 okay so i have two spheres one is evil
 and the other sphere was right with this capital k
 by rotating my crystal all the k was
 magnitude this capital k intersect evil
 sphere is this statement clear i am
 rotating my crystal all at once because
 i have crystals in all possible
 orientation
 so all the capital k with the same
 magnitude intersect here or there my
 evil sphere all of them sooner or later
 because i'm rotating so sooner or later
 there will be the right orientation and
 i'm hitting if i am not rotating the
 crystal it may be that my capital k is
 here
 and then it doesn't meet the evil sphere
 but if i rotate it will touch evil sphere
 and at this point i will see a spot so
 all the vectors that are this magnitude
 will hit this evil sphere sooner or later
 and so they do it all at once because i
 am averaging with respect to my direction
 then if i call
 this the scattering angle phi i have a
 condition
 which is the condition that this is a
 chord of a circumference
 of radius k equal to k prime and so my
 condition is that k in absolute value
 capital k in absolute value is equal to
 2 small k the sine of phi over 2.
 this is called the Debye Scherer
 condition
 this is
 a weaker form of the Bragg condition
 or if you wish
 on the Von Laue condition
 because we are not constraining
 the direction of capital K
 we have lost information
 we do not know the direction of this
 capital K that is fitting
 because it was some direction and then
 by rotating it reached my sphere
 but i cannot measure the angle of
 rotation
 because when i rotate the crystal i can
 measure the angle of rotation
 so i know
 where was my starting vector
 before rotating but now the rotation
 is just the result of the random
 arrangement of all of my crystallites of
 all
 or all my total grains so i have no
 information whatsoever about the
 direction of this game
 but i know that k must be sooner or
 later a chord of a circumference with
 radius k and so if i call phi the
 scattering angle
 which is the angle formed between k and k
 prime this is k and this is k prime so
 it's
 experimentally measurable because i
 measure the angle formed by k and then
 my detector tells me what is the angle
 between k and k prime so i can measure
 five
 i know the wavelength whenever i see a
 bright spot that can give an angle five so
 i change five which means i move my
 detector
 for some five i fix my wavelength for
 instance so case fix this is just the
 magnitude of the player so wavelength is
 fixed i can only change five i start
 nothing nothing nothing at a certain
 point i see a bright spot i put the
 value of the angle here and i calculate
 the length of k then i change five and
 other other bright spot other length of k
 and so i have a table
 like this here i put the value of five
 for instance 10 degrees 12 degrees 15 degrees and so on
 here i can calculate the magnitude of k and i have a list of magnitude of k
 with increasing phi the magnitude of k increases
 so this is very nice because i have the list
 of the possible case in increasing order very nice
 if i increases then k increases so i have say in some units
 four six nine and so on and then i have
 the vector lengths and i must tell what crystal structure can arrange
 those vector lengths in a periodic array
 for instance if my lattice is a cubic
 the shortest length i can find is the side of the cube
 of course all these vectors which are different vectors
 will give rise to the same angle phi in the by share i cannot distinguish
 between a k vector that goes along x a k vector
 that goes along y and the connector that goes along z
 they are different vectors but in the Weisscherler
 they all give rise to the same spot the position of the spot is only
 determined by the position of the scattering angle
 which is the angle formed between the x-ray source
 and the detector position i can change the detector position
 and so i can change my angle phi experimentally
 and i measure the values of phi at which i find the right spot
 then by the formula i calculate those lengths
 the shortest of all if my crystal is cubic
 will be this one and then what will be the next
 possible length in a cubic crystal
 you see that there is no other length in between in a cubic crystal
 the next peak if this is one in some units what is the next peak in a cubic crystal
 square root of two
 and then square root of three and then and so if i have some of them not a large number of them
 some of them then i realize that i can arrange them in a periodic structure only in one way
 so it's a very powerful because even if i lost information about the direction this is equivalent
 to this is equivalent to this all the diagonals are all equivalent so no information about the
 directions but just from the length i can figure out how to arrange those lengths in a periodic
 structure and then i after after a short list like five or six of them i can already reconstruct
 the entire lattice reciprocal and then by mapping i can reconstruct also the brave lattice so this is
 a very powerful method indeed to investigate the crystal structure it seems crazy like i have a nice
 crystal and i grind it but in the end it's very powerful indeed because it gives me at once the
 advantage of the rotating crystal method without rotating the crystal
 questions
 so before going to the final topic of this lecture and then i'll make examples because only with
 examples we can really understand what is going on i will only slightly touch the question that was
 asked before the question about the relation between the structure factor and say for instance x-ray
 scattering pattern so as i was saying before the lecture started there is a syllabus on my website
 and in the syllabus you find what you are supposed to know to take this course and you are supposed
 to know scattering theory in quantum mechanics if i were to make a course about scattering theory
 in quantum mechanics which is a very very nice topic i would not have time to do condensed matter
 physics and i am requested to do condensed matter physics in this course but i understand that some
 of you are not so familiar or have forgotten part of what they knew about scattering in quantum mechanics
 so i'm writing some notes that i will post on my website where i make clear the relation between
 the scattering amplitude of x-ray and the structure factor so of course then if you really want to
 discuss this with me then there is a question after the lecture or consulting time and and i am fine with
 that if you really want to discuss that with me you are welcome of course i'm just saying that i
 will write notes to make a clear relation between the x-ray scattering amplitude
 and the quantity that i have called s of k the structure factor okay this is just two lines of
 perturbation theory in quantum mechanics is it's not so complicated but okay so i assume that you
 know this but i understand that not all of you remember so i'm right i'm i'm writing notes about
 this what i want to say is this so please understand what i am going to say this theory is perfectly fine
 if i apply this theory which is general for instance it applies to liquids if you do a
 scattering x-ray scattering from a liquid you can measure s of k and then by Fourier transform you
 can measure g of r as i told you in the previous lecture and if you look at the g of r of the liquid
 as a function of r you can see the position of the atoms and then it goes to one asymptotic so you can
 say that if i put one atom at the origin here i will find the the first atom in the average here the
 second so i will have shells in a crystal only few positions are allowed so my pattern is like
 delta this is the fourier transform of this which is non-zero only whenever this is a reciprocal
 lattice vector so the s of k of a crystal is only non-zero if k is a reciprocal lattice vector
 this is just for our condition
 so we can discuss x-ray scattering from a crystal without the formula of the structures factor
 because we have taken the shortcut of von laue or bragg formulation but of course they are
 completely equivalent again there is a complete equivalence between the theory of scattering which
 is general in quantum mechanics i have a system i scatter an x-ray and i want to know what is the
 scattering amplitude the scattering amplitude is a straight forward calculation in quantum mechanics
 okay then we can discuss i remember i don't remember how to do that but it's a straightforward
 calculation in quantum mechanics now the question is instead of going through all of this for a
 crystal we can take the shortcut of von lauer formulation this gives us the same information
 as this and the connection is that if i calculate this for a crystal solid this is only non-zero
 when k is a reciprocal lattice vector which means that this structure is periodic
 okay
 let me go to the final topic
 so so far we have discussed been discussing about brevet lattices
 however i anticipated that the most generic periodic structure
 can be described as a brevet lattice with a basis
 and this is true for two reasons
 first reason there are periodic patterns like the honeycomb or the diamond
 that are not brevet lattices i see the honeycomb
 i see that it's a regular array but this regular array is such that the points are not all equivalent
 so i can make two sets of points within each set all the points are equivalent
 so i can describe the honeycomb as the compenetration of two brevet lattices
 one displaced with respect to the other this is the concept of a basis
 the other possibility that is met in nature is the same i have a brevet lattice say for instance a
 square lattice but my coins are not occupied by an atom but by a molecule for instance if i am
 studying ice crystal i have oxygen and two hydrogens here then i have oxygen and two hydrogen here
 oxygen and two hydrogen here and so on and so forth okay so now i'm facing a situation where my
 lattice is a breve lattice it's not the only cone then of course i can have both situations but
 i have a breve lattice but my constituents are not simple atoms they are molecules if the molecule
 is a crystal then every crystal site is equivalent so this is equivalent to this is equivalent to this
 is equivalent to this i have chosen my origin arbitrary as always and i put my origin on the
 oxygen atoms so the oxygen atoms are located on my breve lattice the hydrogens are not located
 on my brevet lattice but it's very simple to locate if i choose this as the origin then i can define
 the vector d2 that locates my hydrogen with respect to the oxygen if i want to locate this
 hydrogen i first move by a brevet lattice vector from an origin to another point and then move by d2
 the two is a constant vector if i want to locate i must change r but not d2 d2 is always the same
 and this other is located by v3
 putting the oxygen at the origin i put d1 equal zero this is a choice that can always be done so you can
 always put one of the atoms at the origin then all the other atoms are located by such a recipe r
 plus d of l for l equal one two three so this is a very regular structure and now you see
 that there is an underlying brevet lattice all the points are reached by a brevet lattice plus a
 constant vector this constant vector is called the basis for each species
 this means that if i take now all the equivalent points for instance now i give a different color
 to these hydrogens these hydrogens themselves form a brevet lattice which is the same
 brevet lattice as before just shifted by d3 and all the others form a brevet lattice
 which is the same lattice as before shifted by d2
 so this recipe tells me that there is one single brevet lattice r and all the atoms
 are located with respect to the single brevet lattice by a constant shift so this is a very
 regular structure and i can separate the brevet lattice which is unique one single brevet lattice
 and the basis now since the basis is not periodic there is not such a thing as the reciprocal
 lattice of the basis the only periodic structure is in r r is periodic so the concept of the reciprocal
 lattice of r is well defined the reciprocal lattice of d is a concept that does not exist
 i repeat this because for some reasons that i cannot fully understand in your mind you are still
 convinced that i am like tricking and that there exists the concept of reciprocal lattice of the
 basis no there is no basis is a finite set of vectors it's three vectors four vectors seven
 vectors the funny set is not an infinite set so there cannot be a reciprocal lattice of the basis
 it's not periodic it's a finite set whereas the breve lattice is periodic and infinite
 and so there exists a reciprocal lattice which is itself periodic and infinite
 so now you ask me i am waiting for a question you told us that when you study a crystal
 by x-ray scattering you can tell the structure of the lattice by x-ray scattering
 then what happens if my lattice has a basis can i tell the difference between two different lattices
 which have the same level of this but a different basis if i do x-ray scattering
 and the answer is yes of course yes of course
 so the end of this lecture is what is the contribution of the basis to x-ray sketching
 so again if i calculate the scattering amplitude
 by a crystal which is a breve lattice i find that this scattering amplitude is only non-zero if
 k is a reciprocal lattice vector okay and this is just bragg or for for let's say for lower formulation
 okay also bragg but bragg had no idea about reciprocal lattice he didn't know so he was
 lucky that mirror planes that lattice planes exist because they are orthogonal to reciprocal now
 if i have my
 and then just to be very general i am not putting my origin on the atoms all the atoms are locating by
 a d1 d2 d3 basis vector okay which gives the location of all my atoms with respect to the basis to the
 reciprocal uh to the point of this then my scattering amplitude gets now a contribution
 i use the same symbol s of k because in the end is a relative of the structure
 factor it's called in x-ray scattering structure factors actually which is in this form
 which means that when i make practice construction i state that my ways
 to make a positive interference constructing interference must obey the von lauer condition k
 minus k prime is equal to capital k this capital k but now i must take into account
 also the fact that for instance when i consider the scattering of this atom
 with the equivalent atom
 the condition is of course the same because all the equivalent atoms are on the same ray
 ray lattice a simple shift but i have also the interference between this and this
 and this with respect to this is located by an extra is like r plus a basis so i have an extra
 factor in the amplitude of the scattered way wave which is of this form now this is true if all the
 atoms are identical which is the first case i will discuss for instance all the atoms are
 carbon atoms or whatever all the same and then these waves interfere according to this structure
 factor n is the number of atoms in the basis for the moment i am discussing the case of equivalent
 atoms and then i will generalize now there are two possibilities
 either this number is non-zero
 and then since this is the scattering amplitude dance this is the extra contribution
 to the scattering amplitude
 due to the basis
 if there is no basis this is a one so if there is a basis this number is not one
 so there are two possibilities this is a complex number but this is not important
 because the scattering probability is the modulus square of the scattering amplitude
 this is the quantum mechanical scattering amplitude whereas the real structure factor
 is the square of this number but it's called structure factor the names are less than the object that
 one would like to study in physics
 but there is the possibility that this wave interfere in a destructive way
 if this is the case if this number is zero the corresponding peak disappears from
 the x-ray scattering so suppose i have a diamond as i told you the diamond can be described as an fcc
 phase centered cubic with a basis all the atoms are equivalent because they are all carbon atoms
 if i make x-ray scattering from a diamond i don't see the scattering pattern of an fcc lattice
 it would be a pcc basically space but i see a b a bcc with some missing points
 why those points are missing because we will make this calculation this object
 on some for some value of k gives a zero on the structure of my diamond in that case
 then i will be able to tell that the structure is a diamond because i will find a structure that
 would be fcc but with some missing points and then by studying the location of the missing points
 i can deduce the underlying structure of the basis
 in the next lecture we will start with exercises on this
 okay so that we put in practice whatever i've been saying now
 now imagine that the atoms are not equivalent
 in this case my structure factor
 which in this context is understood as a contribution to the scattering amplitude
 is a modification of this because now the scattered waves have a different path because they come from
 different atoms so there is a difference in their path that is due to the fact that they are located
 on different atoms but also there is another contribution the x-rays are scattered with a
 different amplitude by the different atoms if all the atoms are the same of course there is a
 scattering amplitude here but it is just a constant because it's the same for all atoms so i can put
 that in evidence but if the atoms are all different the waves scattered by the different atoms will
 be scattered with a different scattering amplitude and so there is a pre-factor
 and this pre-factor is called the atomic form factor
 now there are theories for the form factors of atoms in x-ray scattering but this cannot be
 the subject of our course this is well beyond the scope of the course what the the only point i want
 to make is that if the atoms are all different then all the partial scattered waves are scattered
 with different temperatures and then it is very unlikely that these numbers cancel very unlikely
 because now i am summing sines and cosines but with different pre-factors so
 the chance that they do cancel is zero they can only cancel in exercise when i choose this number
 exactly in such a way as they can think cancel but in real in nature they they will never cancel
 exactly so what i will see is all the peaks of my bravais lattice but with some modulation some will be
 brighter where this sum is larger and some will be fainter where this sum is smaller so i will see
 exactly the same pattern of the original brevet lattice but while in a brevet lattice all the peaks
 would be more or less the same intensity not really but quite if i have a basis the brightness
 of the different peaks will be very different will be modulated and then again again if i look
 at this modulation i can figure out what kind of and if i have some hints about the chemical
 composition of course of my solid then i can again figure out the structure of my solid by
 this modulation of the intensity of the peaks in general a simple-minded theory states that
 this atomic form factor is proportional to the Fourier transform of the electronic density distribution
 so this f okay is proportional to the Fourier transform of the electronic density of the atom
 so i take the my atom in the position dj for instance carbon or hydrogen or whatever this atom is
 characterized by a certain electronic cloud the distribution of electrons around this atom
 and then i take this density distribution i Fourier transform this density distribution
 and i obtain a number which is a reasonable estimate for this atomic form factor
 since this object decreases in real space usually exponentially then the Fourier transform also
 decreases in the reciprocal space so that those numbers will be a decreasing function of their
 of the magnitude of their argument which means that this means that if i study this object as a function of k
 the intensity of my x-ray and this is true also for x-ray scattering from a brevet lattice because
 there again there are atoms all identical that happens so this atomic formula factors are a
 constant that i can put in front but of course are there so if i make a scattering as i told you in
 bright formula increasing n means increasing the magnitude of k because in von lauer formulation
 this n is this n
 to pi over d times n and then some unit vector in the direction so with increasing n i increase
 the magnitude of k when i increase the magnitude of k this number decrease so that even in an ideal
 scattering experiment i would not observe an infinite number of peaks because with increasing k
 so with increasing of the multiplicity of my scattering the peaks will decay become
 fainter and fainter because of the action of these prefactor so it's it is not even ideally possible to
 observe an infinite number of bits in reciprocal space because the bits with larger k will be
 fainter because of the presence of the atomic form factors we will see that there are three possibilities
 first possibility my system is a real brevet lattice and then the scattering pattern is given
 only by von lauer's condition second possibility my system is either a brevet lattice with the basics
 but with equivalent atoms or a fake brevet lattice with the basis
 by fake a brevet lattice with the basis i mean this i can describe the base-centered cubic or the face
 centered cubic which are brevet lattice by pretending that they are simple cubic lattice with
 the basis of course in this case the basis is fake in the case of diamond it is a real basis i
 can never describe a diamond as a brevet lattice diamond can only only be described as a brevet lattice
 with a basis a face centered cubic is a brevet lattice but it can be described as a cubic lattice
 with a basis and then i have two description in one description i am describing is it as a
 body centered cubic for instance and then the reciprocal lattice is a face centered cubic
 in the other case i am describing it as a cubic with a basis so i expect to see
 the scattering pattern of a cubic with a basis but the pattern of a cubic is a cubic so how can
 i turn a cubic into a body centered cubic by eliminating some peaks from the cubic what will
 be the peaks that i will eliminate those that will give me destructive interference and we will see
 this that the two descriptions are absolutely equivalent and then there is the final possibility
 that i have a real basis with real non-equivalent atoms in that case it's a real basis because if the
 atoms are not equivalent i cannot describe them as equivalent they are not equivalent so there is
 no possibility of describing this a breve lattice with a real basis and in this case as i told you
 it's very unlikely that these numbers interfere in a completely destructive manner and so in general
 i will only observe the modulation of my x-ray fraction so in the exercise we will try to
 distinguish between these different ways or of describing our lattices and how these different
 ways impact the exercises so in the next lecture we will start with two exercises one to consider
 the bcc as a simple cubic plus a basis and see how the two descriptions are actually equivalent
 and then we will make an exercise about the diamond structure and there again this imposes
 some selection rules with respect to the purely fcc cubic blocks okay i think we can stop here
 so this is a very important question i want to make this point clear question is
 when i depicted the the structure of ice it was idealized because ice does not crystallize in
 the cubic system okay but imagining that i have some molecules and i put those molecules on my
 lattice so in principle in principle the molecules on the different sides can be oriented differently
 but this is an entropic contribution increases the entropy of the system and usually when i lower the
 temperature the entropic contribution is dominated by the energy contribution in principle at finite
 temperature i should minimize the free energy which means that i should minimize energy minus
 temperature time the atom so this means that if i increase the temperature i will eventually
 find crystal phases where there is a contribution from the entropic term which means that i can find
 some molecules oriented in a different orientation but this structure is not periodic
 so i expect that if i lower the temperature of the system in condition that allow for the molecules to
 reorient sooner or later at sufficiently low temperature all the molecules will be oriented
 in the same way of course the structure of the crystal may be complicated there may be structure
 in which i orient this molecule in some way than the other in the opposite and then the other so
 the periodicity may be but then this means only that my previous lattice is not this but this but my
 system when it's translationally invariant it means that all the sites of my crystals are equivalent
 or if there is a basis they are equivalent up to a basis which allows for my atoms or molecules in the
 unit cell in the primitive cell to be located at different positions of my
 primitive cell but that is the only thing that you can do if your crystal is to be
 periodic. Your situation is a situation that is not compatible with periodicity so
 usually it's unlikely to occur at low temperatures because this would have a
 high entropic cost and would disturb the interaction energy of the system so it
 costs energetically and you can only realize that situation if you accept to
 increase your entropy but this term is negligible when the temperature is low
 and so at low temperature you always want to minimize the energy you don't
 care about the entropy of low temperature you only care about entropy
 when the temperature is large enough but usually this is just a condition of
 pre-melting when the molecule can start to move almost freely then the crystal is
 ready to melt so you are very close to the melting condition but this is a very
 interesting question because i can imagine to freeze my crystal so rapidly
 that the molecules have not the time to rearrange them or in that case i have some kind of amorphous
 solid not translational invariant solid it's more similar to an amorphous crystal than to
 a crystal to an amorphous solid than to crystal but this is so it's possible in principle
 of course but then cannot be described by a crystal theory we are assuming that our solids are
 translational invariant crystals which is mostly the case
 but for instance suppose that i have a mild violation of my periodicity mild violation not too strong okay
 then of course my geovar will be very close to the geovar of a crystal but the pits will
 be large say that here in reciprocal space s will be non-zero not only for reciprocal lattice vectors
 but also for vectors that are not too different from reciprocal lattice vectors so my peaks will
 have a width in reciprocal space will be not delta like peaks which means that now of course since there
 are disturbances of my periodicity my structure is not rigidly periodic and so also weight vectors
 that are not exactly those allowed by periodicity appear in my x-ray scattering in that case of course
 i should go back to the theory of the structure factor and calculate my structure factor not this
 a structure factor for x-ray scattering that i was discussing in the previous lecture and find that this
 is non-zero also when k is different from reciprocal lattice vector so in an ideal crystal i have only k1
 k2 k3 and so on all the reciprocal lattice vectors for my crystal and in between i have nothing
 in a real crystal if i make the scattering of course because of those disturbances that are
 always there some mismatching the arrangement is always there at fine temperature if this is not
 too severe to destroy completely the periodicity of medicine i will just enlarge those speeds
 so these are no longer resolution limited but are limited by the real wind of the people
 there is another lesson here for sure yes yes

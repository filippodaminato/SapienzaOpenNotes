 You are assuming that you have a lot of substrate, ok, so you can keep producing the product,
 ok, and your problem is to find at which rate the product is produced, ok, because you have
 all the substrate that you want, so you can keep producing the substrate, ok, so this
 is the rate, ok, and the rate depends on the concentration of the substrate clearly because
 the more concentrated is the substrate the quicker you will be able to produce the substrate and if you plot this as a function of Cs/km, you show that this rate, ok, the production rate that you are going like this, ok, this production rate is something which goes like this, ok, so the, you start at small parties of Cs, you start producing
 this product with this rate and then the rate is up to the maximum value, so the rate increases, it keeps increasing, ok, so you add the larger is the concentration, the larger is the rate, which is the ratio that we get, but the rate does not increase linearly, I mean at some point it's up to it, you cannot produce the product at infinite rate, ok, and I want you to
 see that this is not B, ok, this is B and D, ok.
 Also, we said that CS is constant in time, but now we are adopting the B and D as a function of CS, so we set a concentration to this piece and then we ask...
 Yes, yes, let's say if you had another concentration, how would the rate it is, ok?
 Of course, this is a rate, so as I was telling you before, this means that you keep producing product, clearly this is a regime that only holds up to a certain point, because even when you have a very huge amount of substrate, if you keep from the substrate to synthesize the product, at some point, clearly, the substrate will lose.
 The substrate will increase and the assumption that we need to have a constant substrate will not hold anymore.
 So this is an approximation which holds in the first regime where you can assume that the substrate is constant.
 At some point you will use the substrate and therefore this rate will block zero F because you will not have anything more to change.
 But at this I just wanted to show you that in this case with one single reaction, one single substrate you have this constant rate of production.
 Okay, so now we will see that here is different, here is different.
 Why? Because one of these two reactions here involves G.
 Okay, involves the product of the first reaction.
 Okay, and we are not assuming that G is in a huge amount.
 The idea is here that Gp is very abundant, so the substrate S is very abundant.
 But G is not. G is produced starting from S.
 So we cannot assume that the concentration of G is constant
 and in T it is a set of coupled equations.
 I wrote down an equation also for the number of molecules in G.
 Okay, therefore for the concentration.
 Okay, so these were the equations that we wrote yesterday.
 These are the strengths that I learned once we used in the basic quantum question.
 Now we need to solve them all.
 Okay, so let's do this.
 And here it's just, everyone has to be patient with just algebra and some digits.
 So you probably got the right result but it was written in a way that looked different from the one in the other but actually it was the one in the other.
 So let's do this step by step.
 So the first thing that we need to do is to find out the stationary state as we did for the simplest case, to find out the stationary states of the two enzymes.
 ok, so we will set a piece of this equal to Z and we will find stationary states for the concentrations of the enzymes, so we have MS.
 I should write stationary states, but please don't write stationary states otherwise we will have four S on one letter and it is really too much.
 so this is stationary state and this would be from this, first here we need to substitute this region here, so should we do this step by step?
 ok, in this case it is really like in the previous case, so don't let me do this again, you just need to substitute here, ok, here we will substitute N total SS minus N SS likewise here, we will do the same here
 ok, and this will be N D G, no sorry, N S, N D total minus N D G, ok, so the first step is to substitute this here, then I set these two equations to zero and I find exactly the same kind of solution that we found in the one equation case, which is this
 where these two cases are the Michaelis constants for the synthesis
 and this is the equation and this is the equation and this is the equation. Therefore the definition is the one analogous to the one of the Michaelis constant that we have before
 this is just gay S minus plus B S over gay S plus, so it's the ratio of the rates that take out from the creation of S
 decrease the number of enzymes S and this is the rate of the reaction that increases the production of the metastatic states
 and this is exactly the same way Kb it will be equal to Kb minus plus Bb and this is Kb plus
 these are the questions related to the production of the metastatic states
 ok so at this point what we need to do is to take this one is here and in a certain path in the equation for 2
 ok so let's write the equation for G so we will have T and G over P
 so let's write this again
 ok so I made some, I think I made some
 so let's see what I did
 so I think this is just, I am probably here
 so I need to write this
 please check that I am writing exam with the same question
 and we have to do this, minus Mgcg
 this one
 it is the same, right?
 so here, I mean, before substituting the stationary boundaries
 I need to implement the constraint here
 ok, because this, I should put it, I should use the solution
 ok, so I will cancel this
 and the step will put N total minus N minus 2
 ok, I exploded the conservation of the enzymes
 ok, so this is just a step
 ok, and then, and then I see what?
 I see that there are terms which contain NSS
 which is this one, and terms that contain NBG
 ok, this one and this one, so I put them all together
 ok, before substituting the stationary values
 I just write myself in the equation in this way
 so I will have BS
 and this remains the same because I have just one of this
 but then the terms of the NBG, they are two
 so I will have plus NBG
 and here I have AB-
 ok, and then I have minus CG
 ok, B plus
 ok, and BG
 B is plus
 because we have minus and minus
 minus and minus, that's it
 ok, and then I have this other term which is
 no, it will also be explicitly
 so let's write it explicitly
 minus KB+
 and the total
 C
 ok, I think we are there
 ok, good
 very good
 ok, so now I can consider this and this
 and I substitute this solution here for the stationary value
 so I will get
 S
 and like this
 and S total
 Cs over Cs plus Ks
 this is this term here
 and then I have this term here
 this is the prefactor so I will start it out
 let me write down the grand consist first
 Kd minus
 plus Cg
 Kd plus
 and then I will put the stationary values of the Dg which is this
 so I will get N D total
 ok
 and then I will get Cg divided by Cg plus Kd
 ok
 and this is the second term
 and then I have the second term
 so minus
 Kd plus
 and the total
 Cg
 so now what I do
 is that
 I want to
 stress the dependence of Cg
 because you see
 Ng is just a Cg
 apart from a volume factor
 to omega Cg
 where omega is the volume
 where our reaction is
 the concentration
 and the number of G
 they differ by a constant
 so they are basically the same point
 ok
 so
 I want to
 this is basically an equation for
 Ng or Cg as you prefer
 so I want to
 give you evidence the dependence on Cg
 so I will try
 to use it here
 if I have Cg, Cg will put together
 the other terms
 so we'll write this
 as it is
 this remains here
 I don't have Cg
 so this remains this
 I don't care
 but here
 I just
 put together everything
 that depends on Cg
 this term is non-linear
 as you can see so we want to manipulate it a little bit
 ok
 so what we have is this
 and this is divided by Cg plus Kd
 this is this divided by this
 you see both these two terms events on this
 so here we have minus Kd plus
 and everything multiplies
 and the total Cg
 ok very good
 ok so now I want to rewrite
 this parenthesis here in a nicer way
 ok so let's do this on one side so that
 we can write another result here
 ok
 so what is this parenthesis here
 I will have Kd minus plus
 Cg Kd plus
 minus Kd plus
 Cg
 minus Kd plus
 Kd
 ok
 divided by Cg
 plus Kd
 right
 ok
 so now
 these terms cancels
 ok
 these terms cancels
 and now
 what I need to remember
 is the expression of Kd
 ok
 so what is the expression of Kd
 the expression of Kd
 I have it here
 ok
 this is Kd
 ok
 so you see when I multiply Kd
 by Kd plus
 this is Kd plus Kd
 ok
 so this is just
 this is just
 this is just
 sorry
 what is this
 what is just
 let's do that
 Kd minus
 plus
 Pd
 divided
 by Kd plus
 ok
 so this and these are cancelled
 ok
 this Kd minus
 this Kd
 ok
 and so what happens is that
 this Kd minus
 cancels to this
 ok
 so this cancels to this
 and the only
 left is Bd
 ok
 so in the end
 the whole parenthesis is nothing else
 than minus Bd
 divided Cg
 plus Kd
 ok
 excellent
 ok
 so now I can rewrite
 this
 this remains the same
 the S
 and S total
 Cs
 divided by Cs
 plus Ks
 ok and the second term
 is exactly analog
 to the first one
 but with the deliberation
 minus Bd
 and D total
 ok
 Cg
 over Cg
 plus A
 ok
 and this is the equation that you find in the other
 you don't find the deliberation
 you find the left
 this
 ok
 this is how we get it
 ok
 it's ok
 Thank you.
 But in principle they are couples, so you need to inform the computations in detail to ensure that everything is well.
 Okay? The intuition is that when you have separation of time scales you can simplify things, but you need to get it.
 Okay. Okay. So this is the equation. So now why is this equation interesting? This is an equation for Cg. Okay? So I was telling you before we can just write this Ng, we can just write Cg and dominion here. It's just a constant difference between two or you can use Ng instead of Cg. It's the same. Okay.
 But the interesting thing is that what one would like to do is now try to exploit this equation to be able to say things about the reaction that's happening.
 Okay. So far this is an equation so you can't really extract much information from that. You need to solve the equation to try to understand what's happening so the first thing that one can do is as usual to try to
 understand what is the stationary scale of this equation. So let's imagine that there is this equation and this equation is going on, has been going on for a while but at some point this kinetics can give rise to a certain stationary concentration of the product which is Cg and Pg.
 So it is describing the fact that you are synthesizing and degrading this Cg and P which would be important for photoreception because we can regulate the opening of the channel of the membrane so we want to try to understand what regulates the production of this Cg and P, what is the value of this Cg and P and what is the time scale on which this Cg and P changes and so on.
 So the first thing that we can do is assuming that we have a certain concentration of enzymes, let's see what is the result in stationary concentration of Cg and P which is the cheating resultation here.
 So we want to look at the stationary state for Cg, stationary state for Cg.
 Ok, so please note that this is a linear equation in Cg, so if you want, linear equations are resolved and linear equations are not resolved, that's why we look at simple things before.
 Ok, so we just look at the stationary state as the processor.
 The stationary state, we find out the stationary state means that we assume that there is no variation any longer of this, of the number of gemolybids, of the CGLP, and we set this left on the side equal to zero.
 So if we set this equal to zero, we immediately find a solution for CGLP.
 And what is the solution?
 Solution that you just need to equate these two members here.
 Don't let me do the algebra, this is really very easy.
 So the solution that we get is the following: CGL in the stationary state,
 okay, so this is the stationary value, is this one here, KB, BD under the S,
 and the total divided by NS total, okay,
 1 plus KS over C minus 1.
 So this is the final result, okay, for the stationary value,
 then I will leave it here because we will insert the regimes,
 which have simplified this expression,
 but for that being, this is the exact solution.
 Okay, so already here, we see what we were interested in,
 namely the fact that actually the stationary concentration of Cg depends on the number of enzymes.
 Okay, so the more synthesis enzymes there are, the larger would be the stationary value,
 the more degradation enzyme that we would have, the smaller would be the concentration of Cg and P in the stationary state.
 And this is important and why it is important because when the retinol changes its structure,
 what happens is that the degradation enzymes gets activated.
 So here I wrote a number of enzymes D, number of enzymes S,
 but I then believe the number of those enzymes which are in the active state,
 which are able to participate in any equation.
 They can be also in a state where they do not participate in this equation,
 so these are the enzymes in the active states.
 So I think for example in the other, maybe they are with a plus,
 I don't remember, but these are the active class of enzymes,
 of those kinds of enzymes.
 So what happens is that when the retinol changes,
 it goes from C11 to C trans,
 some D enzymes get activated.
 And so what happens is that N total D increases.
 Okay? And so this means from this expression as a consequence,
 the value of Cg in the stationary space once these enzymes have changed.
 Okay? And since this concentration regulates how many open channels there are,
 this will imply less open channels.
 And this will imply smaller current.
 Okay? Which is indeed what you see in experiments on photoreceptors.
 Okay? You remember when we commented the experiments on photoreceptors,
 I told you, let's say that here the torch is off, then at some point we turn the torch on,
 okay, and I know in reality what happens is this, the current decreases, okay?
 We actually draw it on the other side, we draw the absolute value of the variation,
 but in truth what happens is that the current decreases, okay?
 So when there is light, the current decreases, okay?
 This is a range of a few seconds, okay?
 But the change, the sound of the change is more light less than light, okay?
 Very good. And so this is what happens and the reason why this happens is that CG is regulated in this way and when this number here increases, CG decreases.
 And then the next step which is this one we will see afterwards, okay?
 Very good. So that's the first thing that you can do, okay?
 And this is what sets the stationary state but with this equation you can also look at something related to the dynamics, okay?
 So we cannot solve the full dynamics because the problem is not linear but what we can do easy is to imagine the following, okay?
 So let's say that we are in a stationary state, okay? We are in a stationary state and then at some point there is a fluctuation with respect to the stationary state
 and we want to understand how long will it take the system to go back to the stationary state again, okay?
 so to do this what we need to assume is that CG is equal to the stationary value, okay?
 plus a certain variation which is small, okay?
 so if we do this, why this problem is a little bit easier to solve because I assume that this is small so I can pull it back here and disregard the hormonal energy, so I'm working on expansion and this I can solve it, okay?
 So what I'm going to do is to take this equation, okay? I'm going to try to solve this equation to find out the dynamics of this data.
 This is a constant value, right, because by definition of stationary values it is a constant value.
 So I assume that there is a small variation with respect to the stationary value and I want to understand how this variation evolves in time.
 So I plug this expansion back here and what I need to remember is of course that the derivative of this is zero, so the left hand side will just be the derivative of the equation.
 Ok, so we get omega derivative with respect to t of this delta g, this is the only part which dynamically depends on time.
 Ok, and then I have to get all the rest, but in all the rest I can do an expansion, so the first term here remains the same.
 So let me, for the type b, let me call this first term a, which remains untouched for what we are doing now.
 Ok, so this is a, this is a.
 Ok, so the only point where there is a Cg is here. Ok, and so let's see what happens.
 So if that would be minus the b and the total and here I would have Cs, Cg, Ss plus the g. Ok, and then I would have this here. Ok.
 So here we have Cg, Ss plus the g plus the g. Ok. Very good. Now I know that the g is very small so what I can do is that I can rewrite this here.
 I can rewrite it as what I can rewrite it as cgss plus kb. Ok. Which multiplies 1 plus delta g over cgss plus kb. Ok.
 And actually since this is a denominator this would be minus 1. Ok.
 And then since delta g is small I can expand. So this 1 line plus this quantity that is small to the minus 1 becomes this. Ok.
 So I can substitute this term here with the denominator just Cg plus Kb. Ok. And the denominator 1 minus delta g over Cgss plus Kb. Ok.
 And now since I know that the g is smaller I can multiply all these terms and retain only the median terms. Ok.
 So this will become a minus bdnb total and then I have c stationary state g divided c stationary state g plus kb. Ok.
 Sorry, let me write this like this and then I have all the other terms c g ss plus delta g minus this multiplied by this so minus delta g c ssg divided c ssg.
 and this term here I disregard it because it is seminal ok so I am ok with this very good.
 ok so the other thing that I noticed is that let's look at this contribution ok this contribution
 here and let's remember this A ok so A is this and the contribution with this is exactly this
 but with the CG stationary state ok but my definition of stationary state in the stationary state
 this term compensates each other ok so this contribution here compensates with the term A
 ok because this is the contribution of the stationary state ok so it goes away
 and so the only term I am left with is this one ok so let me rewrite that I am left with
 from media derivative with respect to t will give the g ok this will be equal to - bb and t total cg stationary state plus kb ok
 then here i have delta g on both sides delta g ok and i have here 1 minus c stationary state g divided by c stationary state g plus kb ok
 ok
 ok
 very good so now what i will then do now we can do the following
 ok
 ok
 sorry
 let me look at what are you going to answer A so the C as with the C stationary state g
 because the A is this term g
 the contribution of this is inside this one
 where C is in stationary state
 ok
 but if you break down the equation from the stationary state
 you can put 0 here so this is equal to this
 ok
 ok
 so now let me write this in a very different way
 ok so the delta G I put it here
 ok so here I just multiply and divide by C G S S
 ok
 now I divide by meter
 ok
 so this is the number
 this point here is the number of G molecules in the section I say
 ok by definition
 and what is this thing here
 so this is the rate
 that we would have
 if only the aggregation enzymes were pressed
 you see
 this is the case of one single equation
 ok
 so you see that when you have one single enzyme
 the rate has this form here
 ok
 so this is precisely the thing that we have here
 it's a rate
 the rate only due to the regression process
 ok
 a rate is the inverse of a time scale
 ok so we can call this one in here
 1 over 2 efficiently
 ok
 why I call it 1 minus coefficient
 because you see that the actual rate of my process
 since I have 1 minus something positive
 the actual rate of my process is always smaller than this one
 ok
 so this is the largest rate that I can have
 in this set of coupled equation
 ok
 because I have 1 minus something else
 ok
 so once I understood this
 what I can say
 so what I find is that
 the derivative with respect to time
 the way my excitation evolves dynamically
 I can rewrite this like this
 ok
 so we already know that the solution of this equation is an exponential
 ok that the case is 0
 ok
 and the rate which is exponential in case
 is given by this and here
 ok
 so the solution would be delta g of t
 equal delta g initial
 e to the minus t over 2
 where tau is the time scale
 the inverse of the rate of this decaying process
 and what is this tau
 the time scale of this graph
 of this process
 1 over tau is equal to 1 over tau efficient
 1 minus cs g
 it will be very effective from English
 ok
 very good
 so this tau is the effective lifetime of this excitation
 so my system increases
 for some reason it increases the concentration of g
 but then the dynamics brings it back to its stationary value of this time
 and why I wrote this
 I wrote this
 because I wanted to show you something
 ah yes, there is also a media
 so there is a
 okay
 okay
 oh yes, yes
 okay, so because once we have
 this version here
 and once we have the stationary solution
 it will be the primary stationary solution
 okay, so this is the stationary solution
 so let me write
 now here I write a really delightful
 effective lifetime
 okay
 so here I have the stationary value
 and the lifetime of any sedations
 so again these two equations
 are very useful because
 they allow me to identify
 an efficient regime for this reaction
 what is an efficient regime?
 an efficient regime is where
 where I have
 oh sorry
 I need also
 I also
 ok but I have it here
 ok
 and also there is a question here
 so what is an efficient regime?
 an efficient regime is a regime where I produce very easily
 the product and I see from this equation it is an efficient regime
 an efficient regime is a regime where this part here which is the one that keeps the rate increasing
 the synthesis part is very strong
 so the larger is this part, the larger will be the rate
 so the rate of production which brings me to the stationary state
 so the FASA will be the approach to the stationary state
 and this happens when I have a good amount of substrate
 so where this term is as close as possible to one
 which is its maximum value
 so this means that Cs must be much larger than Ks
 so the approach to the stationary state
 this implies that Cs must be much larger than Ks
 and this is the first condition
 and then the second condition is that once I reach the stationary state
 if something returns my system I should go back to the stationary state quickly
 and so this means that I should have my lifetime as close as possible to PF
 which corresponds to the quickest possible comeback to the stationary state
 if the stationary state is returned so that's the response on the system
 so to achieve this best response, namely to have tau equal to the optimal value of f
 I need to have this term small
 and so this means to have this term small
 this means that I need to have cg in the stationary state
 much lower than kd
 ok so this should be small
 so these are the conditions that set my system in a very efficient state
 so the product is created very rapidly
 and perturbations are reacted to very quickly
 ok so these are the conditions
 so this is what defines an efficient regime
 ok
 and why it is interesting this efficient regime
 because in the efficient regime
 all the equations simplify
 ok
 all the equations simplify
 because we can exploit these conditions here
 ok
 and so if we assume these conditions
 what in the stationary state
 every expression of top
 what we get is the following
 ok
 let's assume
 that we are in an efficient regime
 ok
 that will be efficient regime
 what do we have?
 let's start by the equation
 the equation simplifies
 because basically this would be equal to 1
 ok
 and this would be equal
 we said that cg
 should be much smaller than kt
 so I can disregard the cg
 in the denominator
 so the equation simplifies
 and the equation becomes omega
 the cg over the p
 equal the s
 and s total
 minus v e
 over kt
 and the total
 cg
 the equation simplifies
 the expression of the stationary state simplifies
 you can see directly from there
 or from this equation
 because what you get is that
 cg stationary state
 it will be equal to
 kv total
 no, sorry, kv
 kv
 and s total
 ok, divided
 this is s
 divided
 t
 mv total
 ok
 and so here we see
 clearly again
 in a linear way how
 the number of decadent design
 is the concentration in the special state
 and likewise
 if we simplify
 the expression of tau
 over there
 the expression of tau
 becomes equal to
 kb
 omega
 divided by
 bb
 and b tau
 ok
 so the efficient regime
 the number of degradation regime
 regulates both the stationary states
 and the response of the system
 to issues
 ok
 so this
 we understand why this is an important one
 ok
 very good
 and this also allows me
 to understand
 how
 the whole machinery
 of this
 of this
 process
 functions
 ok
 and
 to see this
 let's try to understand this
 so let's
 let's put our steps
 in this efficient regime
 ok
 let's assume that photoreceptors
 work in efficient regime
 which is in the end what people found out
 and let's say ok
 so now let's imagine that
 the change of retinol
 changed the number of enzymes
 ok
 so the retinol reaction
 that's not a reaction
 the retinol transition
 for a variation
 delta
 delta N
 D of the enzymes
 ok
 so I have some photons arriving
 the retinol performs this transition
 a certain number
 of degradation enzymes gets
 dilated
 ok
 so I would like
 just like to try to understand
 how much
 the concentration of
 cGMP changes
 ok so let's try to do this
 well the stationary
 value of the genome
 cGMP concentration
 is a function
 ok
 so if you want to find out
 this cGSS has changed
 what should I do?
 I should take the derivative of
 cGSS
 with respect to
 m e total
 m e total
 right
 this is what I should do
 ok
 so since
 the dependence
 is as 1 over x
 ok
 I will get this from here very easily
 I am interested in
 the absolute value of the variation
 ok
 so I can take the absolute value of this derivative
 so that would be
 kb
 vs
 ms total
 vd
 ok
 and then I should put
 nb total
 ms total
 ok
 delta md
 ok
 but this md total
 square
 md total
 divided by md total
 it's going to be 2
 ok
 and why this is convenient
 because this is the stationary value
 ok
 is that the variation
 of the stationary state
 is equal to
 the value of the stationary state
 multiplied by
 the relative variation
 of MD
 ok
 and the best way to say this
 ok
 is that the relative variation
 of the concentration
 is equal to the relative variation
 of the enzymes
 ok
 so this one will be here
 ok
 this one will be here
 yes
 the one in the square
 this is to show you that the
 relative concentration
 are proportional one to the other
 but if I am interested in the absolute variation of CG
 then I need to look at this
 here
 and this probably here
 is called the gain
 so this means
 let me write this here
 the variation of CSGG
 is equal to the gain
 the variation
 and why
 this is called gain
 because the larger is the gain
 the more the signal is amplified
 ok
 so if this
 G0 is a
 large number
 this means that I produce
 a small number of activated
 enzymes
 and
 the consequence of the
 concentration is much larger
 so this is an amplification
 factor
 so the larger is this
 G0 the more amplified
 is the C0
 to really understand
 to really understand
 how strong is this
 is this
 i mean people have
 have this
 so this is the game
 this is the explicit value of the game
 ok
 and so people have tried to estimate
 what this point is here
 for the typical function
 of the receptors
 that we find in real animals
 and what they found
 is that this G0
 is of the order of
 1,000
 this is a very large number
 this is G0
 this is of the order of
 and this I wanted to show you
 this because this explains
 why
 this whole biochemical pathway
 is very efficient
 because
 you know
 we already saw that
 the transition of the retinal
 works very well
 the mechanism is that even though there is noise
 the rate at which this transition occurs is very good
 ok, so when photons arrived
 in a way the system is able to really enhance a true transition of the retinal
 disregarding fluorescence, disregarding black noise and so on
 so already at this stage it is happening in a good way
 but even after that what we see here is that once the retinal performs a transition
 and some enzymes are activated then this signal at the next stage here is amplified
 so if 10 new enzymes are activated
 1,000 more molecules of CGRP will be produced
 there is a factor 1,000
 between that one step and the other
 so the signal is enormously amplified
 for this kinetic equation
 so it has been plenty to work through all these equations
 but this is important for us all
 that we can see and we can measure this kinetic costals
 and we can see that this reaction is really
 with a very, very engaged fact
 very good, so at this point
 we understood that this process is
 very nicely performed
 then at this point we can ask
 ok, what happens later?
 we have this change in the concentration
 of Cg and P
 ok, so we would like
 to not understand
 how is it that this
 variation of Cg and P
 changes
 ok
 so to do this
 I will first make an argument
 which
 will
 which is actually
 it's interesting but it's not a problem
 ok
 and we will see why
 so let's go back
 to the membrane
 ok
 because the current to the membrane
 is the current to the membrane
 so we need to understand what happens
 at the level of the membrane
 so as I told you
 the membrane
 this is the membrane of our cell
 this is a photoreceptor
 and this is in general
 it has some channels
 so some places
 where here you have a protein
 and the protein can be
 open or closed
 so when
 the channel is open
 eyes
 can pass
 to the membrane
 and then they
 polarize the membrane
 so there would be a certain
 variation
 in how the charge
 is distributed inside and outside
 of the membrane and we already
 looked at this process
 if you remember at the beginning of the course
 we made an estimate
 of the
 transmembrane potential difference
 only by considering
 the diffusion
 and we found that
 the variation
 of the progression
 of the membranes
 of the order of the millibots
 so I told you actually
 this is not the whole story
 because there are some ionic pumps
 which continuously keep
 current of ions
 fixing to some specific values
 but in the end
 even considering ionic pumps
 in a stationary situation
 let's say in absolute light
 the potential difference
 across the membrane
 is of the order of 50 volts
 so let's say that this is
 the stationary value
 of the potential difference
 to the membrane
 through a channel
 actually
 and the membrane
 this is by considering
 the terms and so on
 so now
 we would like
 to understand
 what can we say about the current
 so
 ions
 which will pass
 through these
 channels
 and this will be the current
 okay
 so the current
 will be given by
 by the charge
 of these ions
 which are able to cross
 the membrane
 multiplied
 by
 the
 the number
 of the flux
 that goes through each other
 so flux
 this is called
 particle government
 and we need to monitor this by the area
 of the channel
 so let's see how we can complete that
 ok
 so let's see how we can complete that
 ok
 let's see how we can complete that
 ok
 let's see how we can complete that
 so let's start by looking at the current
 so let's say that we are looking at a channel
 ok so this is this channel
 I am just looking in this way
 ok
 ok
 so let's say that my ions
 my charged particles
 they move at a certain average velocity
 which is mean
 ok
 so the numbers
 let's say that we are looking at our system
 on a time scale like d
 ok
 so the number of particles
 and all the particles
 they have a mean velocity
 directly towards the outside
 because the potential difference
 will bring them outside
 ok
 this is the inside
 this is the inside of the cell
 this is our membrane
 so they are all going
 on average
 of course if they fluctuate
 there will be a random contribution
 to this motion
 but this is the mean contribution
 so the mean contribution is towards the outside
 first we have this current of particles moving outside
 and so for this the number of particles moving outside
 in time of t
 that will be this area a
 the particle in this volume
 all they will go outside
 ok? so how many particles do we have here?
 we have the concentration of particles
 let me see what they call it
 yes, the concentration of the ions
 we have the concentration of particles
 but then the current is the number of particles
 per unit time per unit area
 so the current is just this
 ok
 so here I can rewrite this
 as Q
 C
 V
 A
 so now I need to find what is this drift velocity
 ok, these particles
 and this is something that we already did
 so let's say that these particles
 they are ions
 so they are just very small molecules
 so what do they do?
 they will diffuse
 ok
 in the water solution inside the cell
 and they will be subjected to the external force
 and the potential difference
 between the inside and the outside
 of the membrane
 so if I want to write down
 some equation for the movement
 of each one of these particles
 it should be
 let me write an equation
 from the coordinate perpendicular
 to the membrane
 so I just go in one dimension
 so this would be this
 ok
 equal force plus noise
 ok
 this is the usual
 Langevin equation
 ok
 that we already studied
 where this is friction
 and this is a random part
 of this motion
 which takes into account for diffusion
 so for the fluctuations in this movement
 and this is the external force
 due to the
 potential difference of the membrane
 so now I would like to find out the mean velocity
 I just need to take the average value of this
 so I can take the average
 this does not depend on the number of variable
 so this is zero
 and so what do I find
 this is a relation that we already studied
 which is the relation between standard forces
 and brief velocity
 so I found that the force
 sorry
 the brief velocity is equal to the force
 if we want to estimate this force
 let me do this
 but this is easy
 because this force is nothing else
 than the electric force
 so it would be the charger of the ion
 and then I should put the electric field
 but the electric field is delta V over L
 where L is the thickness of the membrane
 so remember
 to compute the potential difference from the inside to the outside
 we need to integrate the field
 so you get that E L
 is equal to delta V
 okay
 and then I have Z
 but Z I can write it
 sorry, K D over D
 okay
 so I have the temperature which is easier to leave
 than the temperature
 okay
 so I have this expression here
 so I can plug everything inside
 okay
 so let's plug it inside
 so I have to plug the current
 is equal to
 Q
 square
 that's a B
 over L
 D
 K by T
 mostly black by the area
 okay
 it's the thickness
 so it's this
 okay
 so now
 we have actually all these numbers
 because we know
 that it is 1 micrometer
 squared per second
 minus 1
 okay
 and then
 we know value of K by T
 the order of
 25 mV
 okay
 K by T
 over Q
 is the order
 if we assume that the charge is 1
 okay we can see
 K by T over Q
 is equal
 so the order of 25 mV
 at the temperature
 okay
 and then the Q is
 the charge of the electron
 and then
 what else we need
 we already know what it is
 okay
 so we can plug the numbers inside
 and yes we need this
 and this
 so for typical membranes
 L is of the order of
 5 nanometers
 okay and the diameter
 of the channel is
 it's even smaller
 it's
 say that the diameter of the channel
 it's 0,3 nanometers
 it's not really smaller
 okay
 and the area
 will be the half of this square
 that will be like a type
 okay so once we have all this number
 we can plug everything together
 okay
 and we can compute
 the conductance
 so the conductance is this
 so everything is the inverse of the resistance
 and so everything has
 the potential difference
 and it turns out that this conductance
 is of the order
 of 20mC
 okay
 20mC
 and if we multiply
 this by
 50mV
 the typical
 stationary value of the
 potential
 what we get
 is that across one channel
 okay
 the current is of one peak of that
 okay
 so the result of this is that
 let me drop up here
 by plugging inside of the
 numbers
 you should find this
 that we found that p is equal to g
 this is a reduction
 instead of the e
 we plug inside all the real values
 so we find that g
 is of the order of 20
 of this events
 that e is of the order of
 15 millilocks
 the result is that
 the carbon through one
 channel
 is of the order of one million
 ok
 why are you of this whole computation
 because if you remember
 the experiments that we did
 with the torch
 we saw that all the changes
 in the current
 were multiples of one million
 ok
 so
 what happens
 is that
 the photon is absorbed
 the retinal changes
 the enzymes are activated
 the concentration of C, G and C changes
 and this change
 opens up one ionic channel
 and this is why
 our power changes
 ok
 this is wrong
 and the reason it is wrong
 is that the time scale
 with which ionic channels
 opens and closes
 is of the order of milliseconds
 so if this was really what happened
 what we should have seen
 in our experiment
 in the global sector
 is that the change of the current
 is instantaneous basically
 on the contrary
 when I wrote to you
 on several occasions
 when I wrote to you the blog
 of the current
 you said the current
 I am writing this with the correct size
 so with this feature
 that would mean that one channel
 closes up because the current
 exists
 but if this was related to just
 what happens to one single channel
 this time scale
 should have been of one millisecond
 instead it is of
 two seconds
 so this cannot be
 the closing
 of one single the only channel
 it is something different
 and what we will see
 on Thursday
 next time
 which will be whatever
 so what we will see
 is that what changes
 is the whole statistics
 of opening and closing of channels
 so the change
 in the concentration of CGLP
 does not cause
 the closing of one single channel
 but alters the whole statistics
 of all the young channels
 the young channels continuously
 open and close
 on very small scales
 much smaller than what happens
 with our experiment
 so it is a continuous
 opening and closing of the young channels
 and there will be an average number
 of open young channels
 it is this average number
 due to the resolution of our focus
 ok?
 so we will see how this will occur next time
 now talking about next time
 I look...
 siamo tutti italiani
 tutti italiani
 ho guardato il calendario
 ho qua in disastro
 perché venerdì è vacanza
 ma di lì è vacanza
 venerdì è vacanza
 cioè facciamo più lezione
 cioè voi una nuova
 facciamo i dati
 voi adesso vi andate a casa
 adesso vi vedete due settimane
 oppure comunque se viene i giorni dopo Pasqua
 ci siete perché è la prezzo
 quindi se io metto una lezione
 mercoledì alle otto e mezza
 voi potreste venire?
 no, quello di Pasqua
 voi avete pensato che mentre io ero un po' guardando mi pare che l'unica possibilità di aule e di vostra disponibilità è che è quello di mattina
 perché voglio dire, lo so che è brutto venire anche a te e mezza, però questo significa che al final non posso prima
 vuoi dire anche a posto vantaggio
 ma io normalmente finisco, le lezioni quando finisco il 15 giugno io normalmente anche prima finisco
 poi possiamo aggiustare anche gli argomenti, vediamo che vorrei fare alcune cose e vorrei fare
 in teoria io vorrei fare 60 ore, vediamo cosa riusciamo a fare perché ci sono un sacco di vacanze
 con una che mi va di fare un sacco di recuperi, quindi vabbè allora io magari se riesco a trovare l'aula
 vi mando un'email per mercoledì prossimo alle otto e mezza, ok?
 intanto se vuoi venire per il Leonardo

 Okay you might remember that we started addressing the problem of active particles
 and in particular we discussed the case of a model of active particles
 which is of active particles and I remind you the equation isometric particles
 we looked at some specific cases
 we said that they are being a little bit better but the kind of equation that we were looking at
 whereas the equation is here
 I want to remind you here
 you mentioned these are not forces but the force is divided by the mass
 and the same symbol just to make things simpler
 and I call this term here
 the active force
 but actually if this active is simply minus gamma b
 this equation reduces to the standard case of a passive particle in presence of an external force field
 so this is the passive case
 but in general this active can be seen
 as the derivative in respect to the velocity degrees of freedom of a certain active potential
 of velocities themselves, of the velocity itself
 and this is what regulates the speed of the particle
 so this is the model basically
 the mechanism that allows you to fix the speed of the particle
 and we look at different cases so for example if this theory is a very sharp potential around a certain value
 this means that your speed should be equal to be not plus some fluctuations
 in the limit in which we also would actually use this as a function of the speed
 but we look at it as a function of the full velocity vector
 Ok, this would be the lambda for potential that we look at
 that we would be at time and this is the circle of the modulus in outcome
 and this is the potential that frustrates the speed of your particle to be closer to the value of time
 and this is an example of potential which is also other different kinds of potential
 and according to the potential that we choose you regulate the speed
 the important point is that the speed is not fixed by this linear relationship
 so it does not obey to the maximum cost of distribution
 because it is regulated by this speed controller
 and we say that the limit in which this strange potential becomes infinitely sharp
 the speed becomes fixed by certain values
 this is a particle that we need to do
 so this is one kind of model that has to be used
 there is another kind of model
 this means when you have something like this
 this means that the particles are removing space
 they will have some trajectories
 they will explore space
 according to the force that they feel
 this term here
 to the noise which is regulated by
 the environmental button
 so this particle
 will perform some trajectories in space
 maybe staying longer
 in the spatial regions
 where this potential is stronger
 and performing
 where there is no potential
 and so on
 like what we saw
 in the case of some particles
 but it will do that
 clipping a speed across the field
 so basically
 the real degree of freedom
 when the speed is that stronger or strength
 the real degree of freedom
 is at the axis
 okay
 but the speed is regulated in this way
 so why for the thermal particles
 for the passing particles
 what regulates the speed
 is basically the temperature
 the environmental part
 okay
 because there is a dimension
 here it is the potential
 to the heteros cross
 there will be also an effect of the environmental part
 but at least on top of that
 so we have two
 a way
 one strong way to regulate the speed
 which was on top of the
 environmental effects
 in these cases
 I mean when you talk about active particles
 noise
 is not necessarily
 an alternative
 it can be
 I don't know
 we treat it in the same way
 a different class of models
 that have been used
 to model active particles
 this is what is called
 the active OSTM model
 OSTM model
 just to remind you
 the standard OSTM model
 we study this model
 and we study this model
 we study it
 in the general case
 with the underdumped term
 but let me look at it
 in the overdumped image
 like this
 ok
 so we have
 a elastic force
 and a noise
 ok but we can also generalize this to standard underdumped underdumped underdumped
 underdumped underdumped underdumped underdumped underdumped and put here a generic force
 and that is
 ok so we studied this particular case
 but we know how to treat this kind of system
 so we can check any of these types of systems
 so for example if I blocked the mean square
 I stuck in the origin
 and I blocked the mean square displacement
 which is like square in this case
 which is the origin of the time
 so in the case that we studied
 which also under the second-order derivative
 here we studied in three case
 we have the first inertia regime like this
 then this is the regime
 and then the saturation
 and the saturation was 2/1 in proportional to KB
 so in this case this is the overdone case
 so we don't have this regime here
 we have the diffusive regime
 so we have the diffusive regime where
 delta x^2 goes by the diffusion coefficient into 9 by T
 so in this case this is just this group here
 and then we have a saturation to the value determined by the potential itself
 in this case if we assume a linear force
 that would be something proportional to temperature divided by the strength of the force
 ok something like this
 ok very nice
 so but what you see is that what determines longer time behavior of the system
 is basically the temperature so the biometric math
 and the strength of the external forces which would be these two terms here
 okay so now let's say that we want to make this bubble active
 so what people thought they said okay
 we will use a very similar kind of regression
 we will use here forces and we will put here noise
 okay I will call it in a different way now we will understand why
 but this noise is different from this one
 okay so if you remember this noise here in the passive case was a gaussian like a noise
 so it was a noise where the properties were the following ones
 I will repeat them again I will remind you this the other time but I will repeat this again
 so the variance, the correlator of the noise is a delta function in time
 ok, so only the noise at the same time are correlated, noise from different times are not correlated
 ok, so this means that my particles move, there is a hint of noise
 then it moves, there is another hint of noise completely correlated to the hint of noise that was given before
 ok, so noise is uncorrelated from time to time
 and then this was proportional to KQT of Z dimension
 ok, so this is the diffusion coefficient
 ok, and this is the diffusion coefficient equation
 very good, ok
 this is proportional to the diffusion coefficient
 ok, so now what changes
 what changes in this case
 so if we set
 if we normalize everything
 and we set the friction equal to 1
 this is exactly the diffusion coefficient
 ok, so this is a question
 the principle there should be a Z
 we set the Z equal to 1
 1, 2, I mean it's been normalized by the friction
 so this is the example
 so now what people did here
 was to assume a noise
 it's nothing different properties
 so what are the properties of the noise in this case
 d, d
 and instead of having a delta function
 ok
 we have something like this
 so this means
 that noise
 are correlated
 however
 a time scale
 what does it mean
 imagine that I am a particle
 I am moving at a certain instant of time
 and at a certain instant of time
 I receive a peak
 a peak for example that pushes me in that direction
 ok
 then the next time step
 I receive another peak
 but the other peak that I am receiving
 is not completely correlated from the previous one
 but it is correlated
 we have this function
 so if the two times are very close
 so one time and the next one
 this will be very close
 very short
 so this will be very close in one
 so the next there is one king
 and the next king will be very simple
 ok
 and the next king will be very simple
 but they will be very strong
 and this correlation
 will decay after some time
 so this means that
 for a time to go
 the noise will make me move
 in the same direction
 so there is persistence
 and this one here
 is called the persistent time
 ok
 so the longer is the persistent time
 the longer is the
 similarity to the movement
 of the particle across time
 ok
 and this
 so therefore
 you see that the noise itself
 has two parameters
 one parameter is B
 which was the same that appeared
 in the last case
 but there is an additional parameter
 that is this relationship
 ok
 and this new parameter
 is a regulating parameter
 from the speed
 ok
 so I can regulate the speed of the particle
 we need to
 and let's see why
 let's assume the simple scales
 where I don't have the standard forces
 ok
 if I don't have the standard forces
 what do I have
 it's an equation of this time
 ok
 ok
 but this is me
 ok
 this means that
 if I now want to compute
 the value of e^2
 which is
 a way of measuring this
 mean of the particle
 ok
 what is it at a certain time
 this is what
 this is v of t
 dot t
 ok
 but this is
 anything else here
 this is just z
 of t
 z
 ok
 ok so this is just this function here
 with the priming of
 the ring
 so it is
 q d d of
 ok
 so you see that the typical value
 of the speed square
 is proportional to one of the top
 ok
 so i can regulate the value of the speed
 by turning
 it's not here
 very good
 and what you also see
 is that if you take
 the limit
 to go into zero
 the limit of this function
 to go into zero is a better function
 mathematically
 so you need for to go
 for this persistent time
 going to zero you recover
 the previous
 passive case
 the standard passive case
 so now
 in the base of one single part
 of these models
 even in the active case
 can be solved analytically
 and the technique
 is the same
 that we saw
 for the standard
 constant blendback model
 in the case of linear forces
 namely you find the propagator
 you find the propagator
 in the space
 you find the dispersion law
 and then you go back in the space
 and then you go back in the solution
 It's slightly more complicated
 because if you remember
 when we use the propagator
 methods of the solution is something like this
 x of t
 equal
 let's assume the initial position is 0
 so we don't have the contribution of the initial
 position but it's something like this
 integral of t prime
 g of t
 minus t prime
 let's say in general x t prime
 and here we will be the nons
 ok
 so in the positive case
 we will have outside the prime in this case
 we have a z prime
 and so the solution is something like this
 ok
 in 1d
 in the dimension we will just generalize
 the vectors here
 and when we want to compute
 average of z observables
 what we need to do
 for example if we want to compute a relation function
 we need to take x of t
 x of the prime
 the average
 so we will have 2 in the nodes of this kind
 which are decide the average of the nodes
 ok? but we know explicitly
 what this average is
 so we plug this inside and we go on
 the difference is that
 in the old case
 if I have something like
 z of the prime
 z of the second
 average
 this is a delta function
 therefore the internal simplifies
 in this case it is an exponential
 so they are slightly more complicated
 but we know how to implement exponentials
 so we can go to these issues
 but we will not go in the details
 the main point for me was to show you
 that this is another way to regulate
 the skin via this persistent function
 ok
 so what I would like to do now
 however after giving you a little bit an idea
 of how we can model activity at the level of a single particle
 is to proceed to the most interesting case
 which is what we will do
 is now to consider models of this kind
 let's say
 we will be sticking to this formula
 is the year or less
 one of the articles in Udabe
 and the difference with what we are going to do now
 is that we will consider something like this
 but now we will have many particles
 not just one
 so we will need to put here on I
 where I is the index of a particle
 so everything will have an I here
 ok
 and so far this is just
 but we will also assume
 that they have an interaction between the particles
 ok
 so there will be
 in principle these terms here
 for this one and this one
 which in this case they just contain
 potentials from single particles
 they can contain
 interactions between different particles
 ok, so for example let's say that
 this F_i external of x
 ok, this would be, I don't know
 an external force of x_i
 which acts on all the particles in the same way
 a confining potential
 which confines all the particles around 0
 for example, this would be
 this kind of potential
 but then we can have maybe
 some potential function
 which depends on the distance
 between two particles
 for example, an attraction potential
 or a repulsion potential
 that makes particles
 for example, not going one too close
 to the other or that
 there is a attraction that attracts
 two particles one with respect to the other
 and we can see that
 for example
 likewise
 when we look at this term here
 this
 I will not call it
 effective at this stage
 we can have
 forces that depend on the velocity
 and the forces that depend on
 the velocity
 in principle they can depend not just
 on the eye but on all the velocities
 ok
 so let's say
 this can be an active part
 which sets the speed
 of each individual particle
 so this can be a period
 with respect of the eye or certain control
 for the speed
 which only depends
 on the same particle so each particle
 must have a speed
 a well defined speed regulated
 by the speed control
 but then there can be some interruptions
 so there can be some other terms
 where there is
 a potential potential
 that we call it
 f e
 which depends
 on pi
 and on b j
 ok
 this is
 the general here
 so typically
 these potentials
 that depends on the position and coordinates
 are potential potentials
 while
 in this case this is a force
 while these forces here
 these are forces that
 act on the directions
 and we will see an example
 of this
 ok
 so let's start to consider
 some of these cases
 so in this case we are
 we are considering sets of interacting
 active particles
 so let's consider one simple case
 so many of these models
 they simplify very much
 they tend to be minimal
 especially in many of the level
 so let's say that we want to simplify
 as much as possible
 so let's say that we take
 this speed control potential
 very sharp so that the speed is fixed
 ok?
 so what we have for all the particles
 the speed is fixed to preserve the binding
 ok?
 for this then we will
 see how we can implement
 this most right
 in an effective way
 so then once we fix this position here
 we need to specify
 here this part of the system is here
 so basically there remain two terms
 to understand what they are
 this one basically
 and the external forces
 we don't want to consider external forces
 so now let's start briefly discuss
 I will not go into details
 just want to mention this
 let's discuss the case
 where we don't have interactions
 in the velocities
 so there is no external
 but we have positional interactions
 ok
 and for example
 let's consider the simplest possible case
 where we have
 these particles, this particle movie space
 which fix the speed
 ok and random noise
 which acts in the directions
 ok
 and let's consider the simplest possibility
 which is
 the fact that there is a short range of action
 nothing else
 so we have this particle
 this particle, we don't even assume
 we have the corner marches
 so if we have these particles
 and they allow to close
 let's assume that these particles
 arrive close one to the other
 they can move back
 so there is a certain distance
 by saying that
 if we consider the center of the particle
 that below a certain distance
 there is an infinite potential
 potential so they cannot go at distances closer than the ball. So there is a short range range function and nothing else. Just a short range function. So if you just consider this very simple model, let's consider the passing case. So the case where you don't have this constraint on the speed, you just have a left back, you have this back, it was moving, but they cannot penetrate the
 temperature.
 What happens?
 Nothing happens.
 And according to temperature, maybe the particles would be more agitated or less agitated, but
 there is no phase transition, there is nothing.
 Okay?
 Just to show the repulsion.
 Okay.
 A very low temperature, there is a compactification, but apart from this, you don't see any other
 particles.
 However, if you assume that the particles are active, people simulated this and what they
 saw is that for certain values of the parameters, this repulsion and obviously, we have the parameters
 of the regular model.
 The episode is very, very strange phenomenon that particles are started for clusters.
 Fair?
 And so you've got maybe some regions where the particles are sorted and some plastic particles.
 Ok? So this is a phase of separation between a sort of dissolved phase, which are particles you would want to run,
 and this compactified process.
 And this is what is called motility induced phase separation, because you don't find this if your particles are passing.
 So this is something that appears only when the system is out of equilibrium due to that thing.
 Ok? And there is a lot of research on motility induced phase separation, because there are actually several experimental realizations of these active particles interacting via the process.
 So this is interesting because you see that at the level of the macroscopic behavior of the system,
 the phenomenology changes when we adapt.
 So the other case that I am interested in, because this is closer to the system with my good study, is the other one.
 So this is the case where we don't put this term here, there will be this term. If you think of birds that will be space or fish or insects or whatever, they cannot compare it.
 So probably we really can resolve this term, but this is not the most interesting part.
 So for the sake of the model and to simplify things, let's assume that there is no interaction in the position of variables.
 We will disregard this term, this point, but we will consider a case of what we have this term here.
 So we have an interaction with respect to velocities.
 So now I will introduce one simple model where we have this kind of term here.
 Then I will elaborate a little bit on analogies of this model and what you already know and then I will describe the phenomenon.
 Okay. So let me introduce first of all the idea of the model. Then I will write it in the same way in which it was really introduced but let me first write down a little idea.
 So the idea of this model is that we can close the motion there. And here we want to put some term here which simulates alarm.
 So the idea is that you want to model collective motion. And the idea underlying this model is the fact that when you think of an ensemble of individuals that move together, the mechanism which is underlying this collective movement is an imitation mechanism.
 So for example when you think of birds, the natural intuition about why they move in this way is that they emanate each other.
 So if I am a bird and I need to decide in which direction I need to move, I look at my neighbors, I look where they are moving and I follow them.
 So this is what is called a level in biology and what is called alignment in physics, so it is a mechanism of imitation. Clearly since these guys they move in space and they want to move together, imitation translates into an erection of imitation, which is what we call alignment in physics.
 So what if you want to model this loop of alignment, which is the kind of force that simulates the loop of alignment.
 So this would be something like this, something like this, and then there would be some noise and then there would be the whole strength.
 We would need a way to formalize examples. So why this is a finite term, why this is an alignment term?
 Because you see this is how your velocity, how your velocity which is here is a line direction because the modulus is big and how your direction will change.
 So the change in velocity and this is telling you that this change is in the direction where you enable some time.
 Ok, so this NJ is an interaction matrix like the water matrix that we use in the model and the Z model.
 Ok, so this is different from zero for in digital and static interaction.
 So this is alignment. This is noise. And this is activity.
 Ok, so this is not rigorous expression. I will try to write that rigorously.
 I need to write it better. But this is a little bit API to contextualize this kind of policy more generally.
 So now that this is an alignment term and that this is very similar to something that you already saw in physics.
 We can relax this in this way. So let me make a fantastic jump to what we saw before.
 So what we saw before.
 So we saw it in equilibrium, easy in line models.
 The Hamiltonian of an easy model is something like this.
 S are the spins and are discrete variables.
 And this is different from zeroes that we are laboring the sides in our arms.
 This is the model that we have already studied in Rayleigh Dale.
 But we have also studied a generalization of this model where the spins are continuous variables.
 They are not discrete.
 This is called the Heisenberg model or OI model.
 The generalization is something like this.
 In this case, for the Heisenberg model,
 these SIs of the lattice are vectors that can point anywhere.
 They cannot just be up and down.
 And the model is fixed.
 So you already can see that there is an analogy
 with the velocities that we have there
 and the speeds that we have here.
 They are directional variables.
 Up to now this is the only analogy
 and then they have a cost-strain models.
 In that case it is not, in this case it is one.
 But I mean this is just a normalization of the speed.
 So it is nothing quite at this level.
 Okay?
 So we study the properties of this model here
 from the perspective of equilibrium statistical physics.
 Okay?
 So we come with it the correlation quantity,
 the correlation between spins,
 correlation, response, response,
 everything that we saw a few months ago.
 And now let's say that what I would like to do
 is to study the dynamics of this system.
 Okay. So I would like to see how this variable of size change in time.
 Okay. Not just the distribution of probability and the heat.
 This is what we already studied. Okay.
 Studied the properties of the system from the statistically
 a really good point. So now I want to look at the dynamics.
 How can I build a dynamic when I have a Hamiltonian?
 There are different kinds of dynamics that can be associated
 to the same Hamiltonian. Okay. But the safest
 possible dynamics that I can build once I have a Hamiltonian
 is a Langevin kind of dynamics which we also already studied.
 Okay. So what is the Langevin dynamics?
 This is the Langevin dynamics.
 I just wrote this two minutes ago.
 The x of a 50 equal force plus max.
 This is a Langevin dynamics.
 Overdumped Langevin dynamics.
 Okay.
 So we can do the same here.
 With the difference that now the degrees
 of freedom of our system are the speeds
 that are not just some axis, they are speeds.
 Okay.
 And the force should be related to this interruption.
 Okay.
 So usually what we have is that the force is the derivative.
 In this case the force would be derivative with respect to the value that we are looking at.
 Of a certain potential of that value.
 So we do the same thing here.
 But instead of having X, we have S.
 And instead of having a force that depends on the position,
 we have a force that depends on the speed.
 Okay.
 So let's do this.
 So now I'll write down the equation for my screen.
 I need to work on the force as minus the derivative of the Newtonian with respect to Si.
 So now Fi would be the derivative of my Newtonian with respect to Si with a minus in front.
 And if I just look there, this would be J, sum over J and my J is J.
 Ok?
 There will be a factor too, ok?
 So probably if I put that here, I will get this one.
 Ok?
 Very good.
 Because of the sport, this will be a form, like a version of the sport that is done.
 Ok, play, and play, and play.
 Plus, no.
 Ok?
 And, of course, here there is nothing that tells me that the spins should have normal wagna, so I should put something for the constraint on the modulus.
 Again, also in isolation.
 Ok?
 Very good.
 So, you see, this term here is the force that is derived from this Hamiltonian.
 Ok?
 This Hamiltonian is an alignment of Hamiltonian.
 It makes spins align with each other.
 This is an alignment force.
 So, this is a force that tends to align the spin one with each other.
 Ok?
 So, now if you look at this, and if you look at this, ok?
 You realize that this is the same thing.
 So, all this, ok? And then we will see why I can say.
 So you see that this term here, this is, here here we are dealing with direction of these things.
 Like something has the spins, and they go to a light in each other.
 The only difference is that in this case, these spins are fixed on atoms.
 They are really the magnetic, the internal magnetic moments of atoms on a lattice.
 So they are fixed there, ok?
 They are fixed.
 Here the directional particles are non-spin, so they have five directions of individuals.
 And these individuals move the space.
 Because we don't just have this equation, we also have this one.
 Here we don't have the language.
 Here the sides of the lattice remain fixed.
 So the first equation is just length psi over the d equals 1, ok?
 Very good.
 So what does it mean?
 It means that even though this equation looks similar,
 there is a crucial difference and the crucial difference is that here
 this quantity is fixed once more.
 On a lattice, neighboring spins are always the same.
 They don't change it now, ok?
 On the contrary, here, this interaction matrix is a function of time.
 Ok?
 And why is that?
 Because if I interact with my neighbors, at my neighbors move,
 who is a neighbor of mine at a certain time,
 might be very far away from me and therefore not interacting with me at a later time.
 So this NIJ interaction countries is itself a dynamical variable.
 And this is one problem. Not only is it a dynamical variable,
 but it is a dynamical variable that usually depends on the positions themselves.
 And why is that? Because for example, typical models they just say,
 let's say that I look at the front of birds, this is not a good example because it is not like that,
 let's say I look at a swarm of insects, this is more appropriate,
 I look at a swarm of insects, insects interact via acoustic stimuli with each other,
 so if they are close enough they can perceive the sound emitted by the other individual,
 but if they are too far away the intensity is too low they can not perceive it.
 So this is a kind of interaction biological one so that if they are close enough they interact,
 if they are not close enough they don't interact.
 So as it is in physics everywhere, usually interactions in physics depends on the distance.
 So this is a good example, so we can just to make this kind of interaction very simple,
 we can say that n9j is different from 0 if the two individuals are close enough,
 so if xi - xj is smaller than a certain interaction,
 and if it is 0, otherwise.
 So this is very simple, minimalistic, but very useful kind of interaction in this kind of system.
 So if the f was enough to interrupt, otherwise they don't.
 So you see, in this case, n is a function of the mutual distance of i and j,
 and therefore, this equation here is coupled with the other one.
 These are two coupled equations.
 The system is alien.
 But my point was that you see very well from this comparison
 that for what concerns the directional degrees of freedom
 there is a strong analogy with ferromagnetic system
 with elaborate moments in physics
 and the difference is in the time dependence of the interruption of this.
 So this is the real difference that discriminates these two cases.
 If the interruption matrix here for some reason remains the same
 then the two systems behave in the same way.
 Very good. So this is the system that I want to implement upon.
 And then what else?
 What else, what else? I think there is everything here.
 So now let's try to understand that a little bit better
 how we can organize the memorial space over here.
 Ok, so let me first describe to you how the model was first introduced.
 Ok, so the first guy who introduced this model is Tamas Hitcheck in that drive
 and this is usually called the Hitcheck model.
 So, he produced the model in the split location, so here we are writing down equations that are delivered in respect to time,
 but after he produced the model in the split steps.
 Also because the paper was mainly in America, so they would have an algorithm for the dynamics
 and once you want to implement a dynamic equation you always need to be seen that.
 So you can see that the system of N particles and the data from these particles were the following ones.
 So I will write this.
 Let me write the first model was in two dimensions but in two dimensions things get united so I will do it later on.
 So we will mention first the notation in generic dimension, degree dimension, generic dimension.
 So let's say the model was this one, I need to compute the velocity of the eagle eye at times two plus one.
 How deep as the one is the one.
 I think he wrong plus one but you can also be discreet in the part up there.
 I will have an alignment term.
 So this alignment term will be something that needs to point towards the neighbors.
 So in the notation that I use it will be something like this.
 This is just the mean velocity of the neighbors.
 But then I want my individual to keep the same speed.
 So first I come to this velocity of the neighbors and then I want to normalize it.
 So let's say that if I use this operator, just defining this way, just takes a vector and normalizes it.
 It's the same direction but it has a normal one. So what I will do is an equal space here.
 So this is EI, T is E.
 So we take the normalization of this vector.
 Once we take this normalization, this is just a unit vector that points in the direction of the naples.
 But it does not want.
 And then I multiply it by the norm.
 So that my velocity has the norm.
 But now I also want to reproduce this noise effect.
 So this is the noise effect.
 So clearly if I add here the noise, I don't want that because the noise will change the norm again.
 So let's see how this is visually.
 So this is the part of the eye.
 And then here there are the navels, the closest navels.
 And these closest navels will have some velocities.
 So now what I do is that I take the average of these velocities.
 And the average of these velocities let me drag it again here.
 So this is again the eye.
 And I take the average of all these velocities here.
 And this will be a vector for example like this.
 And so this equation is telling me that at the new time step my third eye will go in here, in this direction here.
 But then I want to add noise without checking this thing. So how can I do that?
 Once I've done this over here, which is what I have here, I just want to add some angular instruments around this direction.
 Ok? So once I place myself in the direction of the neighbors by giving the norm, I just want to add another.
 Without disturbing the speed, without changing the speed.
 So this is something that I think in their papers, it's another operator that they called Armita.
 And Armita, this operator Armita, of a certain vector, is an operator that takes the vector x and adds a solid angle of variance eta around x.
 Ok? So this is exactly what I wrote here on the vector.
 Ok? So, once you do this, you are free.
 Ok? Ok, so this is a way where you can implement this kind of equation.
 Of course, once you have this over at the theta, you can also avoid this inside.
 And you can also avoid this because these are constants and the direction is always the same.
 Ok? So sometimes you find it like that without the j, without the generalization of the number.
 It's the same. Ok?
 And this is one way where, if you look at the papers written by two-secondary collaborators from the very international team,
 you find this equation written at the level of a discrete electronics.
 So this is a time 2 plus the t and this is a time 2. Ok?
 So you first look at the level of flight and then you operate in your flight direction.
 Ok, and then what about the positions?
 Then once you change your velocity according to this rule, ok?
 You also have the position by the size of t plus the t, ok?
 it will be equal to the size of t plus the i, t plus the t because you are going to change it, ok?
 This is called up forward at length because here you are looking at the velocity and attempting to do the t plus the t and move it.
 Ok, so this is how it was performed in this paper.
 Ok, very good.
 So now let me, before I am moving a little bit more in detail on this connection to this population here.
 And this population here, continuous variables, ok.
 Let me tell you actually on this denotation that they used in the very first paper, which was in 2D.
 Because in 2D everything is easier, but this is general.
 So these kind of equations here, like written in this way, you can write them in any dimension if you want, ok.
 For the D=2 case, there are some significations.
 And why is that?
 Because in D=2, ok, in D=2 let's assume that you look at bird I, ok.
 Let's consider the axial direction as reference direction.
 So the velocity and let's say that this is the velocity of bird I, ok.
 So you see that the velocity of bird I is completely specified by one hour, ok.
 The polar hour is here, this one, ok.
 So in this case if I have a fixed speed, V I can be written in this way.
 okay so this is to say that the i x is equal to the 0 of the size
 the i and the i y is equal to the 0 of the size
 and i can learn these equations because if i now write
 by the i y divided by the i x, this is just the tangent of the i
 therefore the i is the upper tangent of this ratio
 very basic things, ok?
 the i is the upper tangent of the i y divided by the i x
 ok?
 very good
 so now let's try to compute this item here
 the average velocity of the neighbors, ok?
 so let's assume that i want to compute the average velocity of the neighbors
 ok?
 what is this?
 the average velocity of the neighbors
 this will be 1 over i
 ok?
 without normalization
 so this will be
 the sum
 over j
 and ij
 ok?
 this specifies
 who are the neighbors
 and then i input j
 so this will be what?
 this will be z not
 sum
 over j
 and ij
 let's write it as a vector
 ij
 sums
 j
 ij
 sums
 ok
 ok
 very good
 so let me call now
 zeta
 this will be a vector
 this will be a vector
 this will be a vector
 this will be a vector
 this will be a vector
 very good
 so let me call now
 zeta
 this will be a vector
 this will be a vector
 this will be a vector
 ok
 so let me call the
 the answer of this vector
 I call it
 psi
 ok
 so this is the vector
 will be some
 modulos
 ok
 could be
 yes, some modulos
 enable modulos
 and then it could be
 cosine
 side
 sine
 side
 ok
 ok
 ok
 so now we want to find the side
 because the side defines the direction
 where the labels are flying
 ok
 so we know that
 side
 will be
 the upper tangent
 of what
 of the labels
 y
 divide it
 v labels
 x
 exactly the same formula
 but
 in this location here
 I know what is the y component
 and the x component
 and what is the y component
 so this will be
 the upper tangent
 of what
 sum over j
 and a j
 cosine of phi j
 divided sum over j
 and a j
 sin of phi j
 and this is the direction of the neighbors
 ok
 so now in the case of two dimensional system
 if I want to understand
 where my individual
 will move at the next time state
 I can express this
 directly in terms of angles
 so what I would say
 is that the angle
 of my individual eye
 at time t plus the t
 will be what
 will be the angle of the neighbors
 this side of the
 other tangent
 of the sum over j
 and ij
 cosinus of phi j
 at time t divided sum
 over j and ij
 sinus of phi j
 at time t
 ok
 and then at this point
 I can really add
 a noise
 because this is a noise
 on the angle this is not a noise on the vector
 so it does not change the speed
 ok
 this is a random noise
 on the angle
 now I can just study that
 it will not change the speed
 because this is an equation for the angle
 and then of course
 v_i
 at times t plus t
 will be equal to 1
 v_0
 and then of course
 sin v_i
 t plus t
 sin v_i
 t plus t
 sin v_i
 t plus t
 sin v_i
 t plus t
 sin v_i
 t plus t
 so this is the trivial definition
 of the velocity of the angle
 and the speed is contained
 and the equation for the positions
 is always the same
 xi
 of t plus t
 is equal to xi
 of t
 plus vi
 of t plus t
 of t
 ok
 so in the two details
 when you write explicitly everything
 as an update equation
 on the angle so it is explicit
 the fact that the angle is the only
 piece of freedom
 the speed is fixed
 very good
 ok
 so now
 let's
 discuss what each set
 found
 and then let's
 reconnect
 what should I do
 before
 now what I would like to show you
 is that
 is how we
 will go from
 a discrete updated question
 to a continuous updated question
 ok
 and how we can
 implement in a different way
 the cost-friendly
 ok
 so let's say
 that
 keeping the idea
 that I am using model
 I write something like this
 ok
 but I want to write down
 that there is
 noise
 we need to implement
 the correct way noise
 and constrain
 and I will just show you some ways
 in which you can do this
 we have the tech operator
 we have operator
 the angles
 but I will deal with this later on
 for the time being let me deal with this
 so the first problem
 I want to address
 is that this is a dispute equation
 and I want you to understand
 whether I can do a continuous
 behavior in time
 so
 when Richsec
 brought his model
 actually
 when
 he summed
 the neighbors
 he included the party itself
 ok, so actually
 this MIJ
 is different from 0 also
 high of J
 in his original version
 if we want to reproduce
 the Dolphinus limit
 then we need to assume something
 that's very different
 Richsec always has studied
 so this was not a problem
 but if we want
 for the sake of
 analytical arguments
 what do we need to do?
 Well first of all
 we need to separate
 this contribution
 the same term
 and the other terms
 so we should need to write this down
 like this
 pi
 equal
 we have the term
 j
 so we have pi
 maybe some coefficient in front
 in the rich set correlation
 the coefficient was the same
 for all members of the sum
 but this is not good
 to get to continue
 what does it mean by coefficient
 and ii
 it means
 it means that
 you
 ok
 i assume it was
 different i from j
 yes but in this case
 he included also
 the neighbor i
 it is
 a sum over the neighbors
 and on itself
 ok it is a sum
 so if this is i
 ok
 and here are all the neighbors
 the neighbors close and are going to set an interactive
 angle where he computes
 the average direction of the next
 side step the individual
 other geographers
 including in itself
 ok not within
 itself
 this side includes
 the I itself but this is
 the I and I T of the previous time
 ok
 but this does not
 allow to
 continuously with
 properly so we need to separate
 the one
 itself and the one of the other ones
 and it is natural to assume
 that they will weigh in a different way
 ok
 so we will if we want to take a continuous
 limit we need to
 take
 this individual
 with a weight one
 ok
 and actually
 we need to take into account
 the other ones
 with a
 with a weight that depends
 on the integration
 for each set this was one
 actually so here
 each set the question was this
 ok
 we don't have any
 but now we want to take the limit
 from the people to zero
 so we really need to
 assume that that date
 that interval coming out
 infinitesity is small
 so we really need to protect it here
 and we will change the weight
 of the individual itself
 with the neighbors
 in such a way that this is
 one of the one
 and the other ones
 have a weight that depends
 on the T-cell
 ok
 this is a weight in biology
 this is a weight like saying
 I always know precisely
 well how
 I am flying
 but the ability with which I can evaluate
 how the others are flying
 depends on the time of my communication
 ok
 so this is key stating here
 mathematically
 this is what you just need to do
 to make the continuous
 ok
 so we have J
 which is different from I
 you can just say that N and J
 has 0 and 1
 weights of sense I think
 and all the rest
 all that is here should skate
 with the J
 ok, in some way
 not just linearly
 you know that noise
 scales as to 1/2
 but all the terms should depend
 on the J
 why I make this
 because if I have this
 I can just bring this to this side
 okay
 so we have the I
 this plus the T
 minus the I
 of T
 I can divide by the T
 and get something that has
 the correct limit for the T
 and here I can get J
 sum the J
 M and J and V J
 plus the other
 that we are going to determine now
 ok
 so if you do like this
 you have to find the
 continue limiting time
 in the original version
 I mean
 but it wasn't formulated
 for this big time
 this is not
 a problem of the model
 the model was formulated
 but if one wants
 to
 imagine a
 there is no limit that
 like this
 and the difference between
 this formulation and this formulation
 for 5D
 there is no difference
 so the model is actually the same behavior
 and still have to tell you what it is
 ok?
 but this is just what you need to do
 if you want to
 give the continuous version
 so now let me
 let me start to address
 the problem
 of how in a continuous version
 like this in time
 how can I do
 to implement the constraint
 ok
 so typically
 when you have
 in your question say you want to
 constrain the
 constraint so you have a question this time
 right
 you have a certain force
 this force is the alignment force
 I think very generally with this
 and then we will add
 some noise
 ok
 and we know that these two terms
 in principle change
 the normal v_i
 so if initially v_i
 has gone with zero
 if I just bluntly
 put a force
 in a random force
 an alignment force in a random force
 these two forces will change
 to the normal of the velocity
 so if I just take this
 this term will make
 it is what it is
 it depends on the velocity of the
 network but it will change
 it will change
 the normal of the velocity
 so if this is the i
 let's look at the motion there
 I now come with this term here
 the chemical velocity
 of the networks
 is something like this
 ok
 this is a time t
 time t
 that is telling me that
 the v variation in a time t
 should be this vector
 ok
 sorry
 the v should be this
 so if this is this
 this is the velocity of the networks
 that got some here
 ok
 maybe larger
 so let's say that this is
 v of t this is the velocity
 of the networks
 ok
 then v i
 ok should be equal to
 j by t
 sorry yes
 in networks
 ok so this is the reservation here
 reservation here
 okay
 sum of a j
 if i make j
 j
 this is the j
 in networks
 in networks
 without an organization
 it is multiplicity
 multiply by the t
 if i multiply this by the t
 this becomes small
 the t is small
 so this would become some small factor
 so we are making something like this
 and what is the
 the t i need to take
 the i and
 how does this go here
 ok
 this will be the new
 the i
 which as you see
 is closer to velocity
 so this is getting
 it's trying to align
 ok
 but you see
 that in general
 this operation changes the norm
 ok
 as we expected
 this operation changes the norm
 so this term here alone
 it changes the norm
 again the noise will again change the norm
 so this does not concern the norm
 so we need something to concern the norm
 ok
 so typically when one wants to under constraint
 and we have already seen this
 the way to do that
 we will use Lagrangian multipliers
 ok
 so let's say
 that we want
 to add Lagrangian multipliers
 and we will add a term
 here
 which will be lambda plus
 multiplied by V
 it is Lagrangian multiplier
 ok
 and why this is Lagrangian multiplier
 because remember that
 on the right hand side
 everything has a dimensional force
 ok
 what is the constraint
 that we want to put to the constraint
 is that V I square
 should be equal to V zero square
 since the normal system
 ok
 and
 so if in the Hamiltonian
 we add an Lagrangian multiplier
 for V zero square
 we would get
 something like V i square
 minus V zero square
 this would be in the Hamiltonian
 when you derive
 something for you
 which has a dimension of a force
 you get the element like this
 ok
 ok
 now
 even without this argument
 let me show you why
 this makes our job
 so we have this new term here
 and this lambda is something
 that is there
 because it needs to force
 the node
 ok
 so you can also see that
 this is a speed control potential
 ok
 remember when we had speed control potential
 and you choose lambda
 in such a way
 that at each time step
 your velocity is equal to V
 ok
 this is a little bit the idea of this term
 but now let's see how it works
 ok
 to see how it works
 we just take this equation
 and we impose
 that the norm is fixed
 ok
 so if the norm is fixed
 what does it mean
 it means that V I squared
 should be constant
 ok
 so lets derive this
 ok
 this means that V I
 the V I squared
 D
 should be equal to 0
 ok
 but I know
 that V I squared
 can be written also as
 V I dot V I
 dot V I
 ok
 so if I write this
 and I post that it should be equal to 0
 what I get is that V I
 dot the V I
 over the P
 should be equal to 0
 ok
 ok
 ok
 so if I take this election
 and I take this color product
 of both sides
 ok
 I should get this
 ok
 ok
 so let's do this
 so here
 I will have 0
 well
 this is the box where we will have 5
 fi
 fi dot bi
 plus ci
 dot bi
 plus lambda
 and here is
 bi squared so I know this is a constant
 this means it is squared
 ok so I get this
 I get this
 question
 and
 and so I derive
 the value lambda
 ok this tells me
 that lambda
 is equal to what?
 lambda is equal to minus
 f i dot v i
 divided into 0 square
 minus
 ci dot v i
 divided into 0 square
 ok
 so now
 that i know
 what is lambda
 i can run it back here
 and write down my equation
 where i have
 anything i need
 ok
 so let's do this
 so what i left
 the v i
 or v
 will be equal to the fourth
 ok
 and then i have
 this term here i have the i here
 so lambda let's write down
 the term that i need
 is lambda multiplied by i
 ok so i need to plug this in
 so the first term is this one
 so let me put it here
 this is this term here
 i have distributed this
 zero square here and here
 and you will still understand why
 last term i have the same structure here
 c_i minus c_i / d_i of the node d_i of the node
 ok so what are these two terms here?
 these two terms here are the step to be the perpendicular component of the force from the noise
 that would be the perpendicular component
 let's say that I have a generic vector w
 ok and this is w
 and I want to decompose w
 along a certain direction
 so let's say that I take this direction here
 and this direction according n
 ok
 so with respect to this direction n
 w will have a logistical component
 which is this one
 so this will be w parallel
 and a vector-negolar component
 which is this one
 w vector-negolar
 ok
 and this n is just along one vector
 ok
 so what is the longitudinal component
 the longitudinal component
 along the vector n
 is just W dot n
 multiplied by n
 do you agree?
 just projecting in the direction n
 ok
 and what is the perpendicular component?
 the perpendicular component is just the full vector
 minus the mobility in a component
 ok
 therefore it would be W minus
 plus W of M something like that. So this structure here means that I am looking at the perpendicular component to the direction M. Ok? So this is FI perpendicular, the perpendicular component of the force with respect to the velocity of the curve, to the right direction of the curve.
 And you see this binot here remains this vector, a normal vector, so this is exactly this rotation here, okay.
 And again this is CI perpendicular and this is the component of the noise perpendicular to the direction of the velocity.
 And this is, I mean physically it is very simple, you have this particle, you want to be a force on this particle, but you cannot change the norm.
 So all the longitudinal component of the force does not anything at all, because the norm is constrained, so only the perpendicular component can change the angle.
 And this is what you are writing. So this is a different way of writing, why I am telling you this, because if you want to do analytical computations, you want to write down continuous equations, it is more convenient to write calculations in this way.
 Of course, if you need to do a simulation, the big set way is, okay, so these are different ways of looking at the same kind of problem but implementing the normals like in the way that is more convenient than what you have.
 So now that we have finished this part here and we have seen the formal level bridge set model in many possible ways. Let me tell you what did bridge set find.
 Okay, so let's go back to the original bridge set model to the formulation, one formulation in the script that I have already explained to you.
 Okay, so let me write the general one that is valid in all directions, in all dimensions, sorry, which was this one.
 It was V0, par eta, eta of sum over J, mi J, dj.
 Okay?
 So what are the parameters in this model? Let's try to figure out what are the parameters.
 And then we have side plus one, equal side of t, plus bi of t.
 Okay? Because he kept the individual.
 So what are the parameters?
 Well, you have the parameter that tells us where two individuals are interacting.
 And exactly the same.
 Okay, the simple interaction model that I told you before.
 So he said there is a certain interaction radius.
 I don't remember whether he called it RC or not.
 I don't remember.
 So let's say this is .
 Okay?
 So if J, if individual J is within this distance of my data,
 otherwise they will.
 Okay?
 It's a simple metric rule of interaction.
 We know certain distance beyond that.
 So there is these parameters.
 And then there is, of course, the amount in zero.
 The velocity speed at which they move.
 And then there is another parameter which is either.
 But then there is another interesting parameter
 which is not evident from the model.
 And what is that?
 Imagine that you look at hidden simulations.
 So imagine that you do simulations.
 You have all your particles.
 These particles move.
 And they are in a box of size L.
 So clearly, etna is the number of particles in your model.
 But this is not an intensive parameter.
 However, if we look at the number of particles divided by the volume.
 This is the density.
 And this is an important problem.
 So the density of the particles will be bigger.
 And now I will try to make you understand why.
 Ok?
 So let's say that you have a certain density in your system.
 What does the density fix?
 The density fix is how many angles you will find inside this region.
 So if you have a large density you will find many angles inside this region.
 So this sum will run among more angles.
 If you have a lower density, maybe here there will be just a little more.
 Ok? So that's the actual degree of interaction in your system.
 Because it's true that, I mean, here this is a normalization factor.
 So everything that goes in here, if I put a J, this goes away because here we are normalizing.
 Right? So any constant does not change. But, when you need to understand that
 when you sum by a certain number of variables, the more variables that you have,
 the more you arrange out the noise. It's the second limit here.
 So when you have more neighbors inside your interruption range,
 the other jingle out of the neighbors will take away noise and you will align them.
 So this makes a real difference, it's not just that since you have a filter here it does not matter.
 So you can also understand from this example that in this model clearly R0 and R0 are not independent parameters.
 Because if I take the same density but a much smaller value of R0, such that for example I only have this one, then clearly these two situations are as you will say.
 Ok, so R0 density, typically they are connected to each other, they are not independent and indeed what people do is that they fix R0 equal to 1 and they don't change it, but they change the density.
 Ok, very good.
 So it turns out that the two important parameters here are these two.
 The noise, the amount of noise that you have in the system, this eta, remember, in this operator, this eta is the variance of the angle with which eta turns the estimate of the nearest direction.
 Ok?
 So eta is the variance of the noise.
 They call it eta.
 It's the angle of the temperature, but they call it eta.
 Ok?
 So these are the two relevant parameters.
 First, increasing the raw, you increase the strength of interaction.
 Ok?
 Increasing eta, you increase the noise.
 And if you think back at the easing model, if you remember,
 what was important to determine whether you are in the open phase,
 is the ratio between the temperature and the interruption strength.
 So again, it's always these two parameters that regulate whether you are ordered or resolved.
 And also here, they are defined in a different way but the meaning is always the same.
 This is something that tunes the strength of interaction and this is something that tunes the noise.
 So it's always the same two parameters that we use.
 So let's say, okay, we say so, let's try for example to simulate this model of large noise.
 Okay? What do you see? When you see that these particles, they move in rather direction.
 The system is disordered. Okay? So let's say that now you start with the basic noise.
 You know that there is an alignment interaction, so these individuals tend to align to each other among networks.
 So, the idea is again the same, that in the easy ideas in the models, with at some point this tendency to put on an alignment will win over the dynamic noise.
 Okay, and he found out that there is a transition, so he defined a quantity that was called the polarization, which is the analog of polarization.
 Okay, and how it is defined? Well, let's just define, let's say, a vectorial of the polarization, you see the one over N, some over I, the I already know.
 Okay, so this is a point we did, if everyone flies exactly in the same direction, it's one. Otherwise, if everyone flies in random directions, it's zero.
 So exactly as we call it the magnetization is something that defines the presence of a direction.
 And then you take the models and you have the scalar polarization.
 Okay, so let's look at what happens as a function of the attack to the scalar polarization.
 Okay, and so he makes a simulation of a certain size L and he finds something like this.
 Okay, so there is a critical value and around this critical value you get told.
 And he said okay, this is a certain value L and one, let's try two and three increasing sizes of L and this becomes sharper and sharper and sharper.
 Okay, so as you increase the size the transition becomes better and better.
 Okay, well and you can also compute the fluctuations of this quantity.
 Okay, this quantity here, this is a quantity that if you have a phase transition it should diverge.
 Okay, and again it computed as a function beta at a certain value of 1 and we found something like this
 and another size, another size, increasing the size becomes more and more picked around a certain value.
 And you can look at more sophisticated quantifiers of the presence of a transition in the thermodynamic limit.
 We already discussed that phase transition are defined only in thermodynamic limit.
 So numerically if you want to see if there is a transition you always need to compute things of different sizes
 and look how these things behave in the sides.
 There is another quantity which is what is called the bilter parameter which should behave in a certain way
 if there is a transition that displays the correct behavior.
 So ok there is a transition to collective motion.
 So what is when we published this paper there was a huge surprise and a huge discussion in the community of physicists.
 Why is that? We see all the time groups moving together there is collective motion.
 So what was surprising about this discovery?
 Well, the surprise was that he found everything that I am discussing here with you in D = 2.
 So in D = 2 and the surprise is that the equilibrium analog of this model which is the Isabel model in D = 2
 that I discussed before which is called the XY model.
 The XY model does not have an original model. It does what is called a quasi-model.
 So the transition does not exist immediately.
 So if you look at final sizes it seems to you that there is a zero column magnetization in the XY model
 but as you increase the size this polarization goes to zero.
 So it's a finite size effect.
 So the surprise was that in D=2 if you are in equilibrium you don't have a transition in the thermodynamic limit
 while if you add the concept partial you get the transition.
 So this is from the point of the study of physics.
 This is the way we say the activity and the presence of this additional ingredient
 which changes the large scale characteristics.
 Of course in D=3 it is less surprising
 because the Eisenberg model has a thermodynamic transition
 it also means that the model has this transition and it is less surprising.
 In D=2 it was surprising.
 So this is just to say that activity and self-proportional
 and self-proport can really change a lot
 behavior of self-proport.
 And why is that?
 What is that changes?
 Why is not a really human
 effect that worked out?
 Okay?
 We can see in different ways.
 The first way to give way is that
 the function is equal to equal 3
 on a lattice
 is the number of nodes.
 So in equal 3
 you have enough nodes to make
 your alignment stronger
 and in equal 3 you have less.
 This is one way of saying this.
 Another way of saying this is that
 and we have shown this
 is that
 and what is that makes the difference here?
 What makes the difference here
 is that imagine that you look at this model
 and at a certain distance of time
 you have some of these nails
 ok
 but then let's now integrate
 over a certain amount of time
 over a certain amount of time
 since there will be space
 maybe some new ones
 which were here
 will enter here
 and maybe some of these
 will go away
 but if instead of looking at
 what is half of time
 you look at a little bit a larger time window
 effectively your individual
 will have interacted with more
 individuals than if it were
 of the space
 just because due to movement
 another way of saying this
 and we will go back for this next time
 because I know it's too late
 another way of saying this is that
 you have two different ways
 of transmitting information
 to other individuals
 one way is the way
 that you have to allow this
 I align with you, you align with him
 Kim aligns with her
 and so on
 so we remain fixed in space
 but we pass the message
 and the message passes
 because we interact
 I interact with you, you interact with her
 she interacts with the other guy
 so there is this passage
 but in this case here
 there is this mechanism of course
 but there is another mechanism
 the other mechanism is
 I travel to you
 you are not my neighbors
 but I travel to you and I give you a direct message
 and this
 therefore
 movement
 reinforces
 propagation of information
 and in this way
 stabilizes the mechanism
 and
 next time we will see what changes
 at the level, at the former level
 of the quantities
 that we want
 so we begin on Tuesday
 and then
 for level level 2
